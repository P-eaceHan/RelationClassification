H01-1001.1 is ubiquitous and carries important information yet it is also time consuming to document. Given the development of H01-1001.2 one could just record and store a H01-1001.3 for documentation. The question is, however, how an interesting information piece would be found in a H01-1001.4 . Traditional H01-1001.5 use a H01-1001.6 of H01-1001.7 as the H01-1001.8 but H01-1001.9 may offer additional H01-1001.10 such as the time and place of the rejoinder and the attendance. An alternative H01-1001.11 could be the activity such as discussing, planning, informing, story-telling, etc. This paper addresses the problem of the H01-1001.12 of those activities in meeting situation and everyday rejoinders. Several extensions of this basic idea are being discussed and/or evaluated: Similar to activities one can define subsets of larger H01-1001.13 and detect those automatically which is shown on a large H01-1001.14 of H01-1001.15 . H01-1001.16 and other H01-1001.17 such as the H01-1001.18 might be available on the H01-1001.19 and could be used directly. Despite the small size of the H01-1001.20 used some results about the effectiveness of these H01-1001.21 can be obtained.
To support engaging human users in robust, H01-1017.1 which reach beyond current capabilities in H01-1017.2 , the H01-1017.3 [1] is funding the development of a H01-1017.4 for H01-1017.5 which all H01-1017.6 participants are using. In this presentation, we describe the features of and H01-1017.7 for a genuinely useful H01-1017.8 for this purpose.
At MIT Lincoln Laboratory, we have been developing a H01-1041.1  H01-1041.2 . The H01-1041.3 consists of two H01-1041.4 , H01-1041.5 mediated by a H01-1041.6 called a H01-1041.7 . The key features of the system include: (i) Robust efficient H01-1041.8 of H01-1041.9 (a H01-1041.10 with H01-1041.11 , relatively H01-1041.12 , and frequent omissions of H01-1041.13 ). (ii) High quality H01-1041.14 via H01-1041.15 and accurate H01-1041.16 of the H01-1041.17 . (iii) H01-1041.18 and porting to new H01-1041.19 via H01-1041.20 . Having been trained on H01-1041.21 on missiles and chemical biological warfare, the system produces the H01-1041.22 sufficient for content understanding of the H01-1041.23 .
The purpose of this research is to test the efficacy of applying H01-1042.1 , originally devised for the evaluation of H01-1042.2 , to the H01-1042.3 of H01-1042.4 . We believe that these H01-1042.5 will provide information about both the H01-1042.6 , the H01-1042.7 and the H01-1042.8 of H01-1042.9 . This, the first experiment in a series of experiments, looks at the H01-1042.10 of H01-1042.11 . A H01-1042.12 showed that H01-1042.13 can differentiate H01-1042.14 in less than 100 H01-1042.15 . Even more illuminating was the factors on which the H01-1042.16 made their decisions. We tested this to see if similar criteria could be elicited from duplicating the experiment using H01-1042.17 . Subjects were given a set of up to six extracts of H01-1042.18 . Some of the extracts were H01-1042.19 , others were H01-1042.20 . The subjects were given three minutes per extract to determine whether they believed the sample output to be an H01-1042.21 or a H01-1042.22 . Additionally, they were asked to mark the H01-1042.23 at which they made this decision. The results of this experiment, along with a preliminary analysis of the factors involved in the decision making process will be presented here.
H01-1049.1 is a new paradigm for H01-1049.2 . We integrate a H01-1049.3 with H01-1049.4 that mediate between H01-1049.5 and H01-1049.6 . We have built and will demonstrate an application of this approach called H01-1049.7 . Using H01-1049.8 , tactical personnel can converse with their logistics system to place a supply or information request. The request is passed to a H01-1049.9 for execution at the appropriate H01-1049.10 . H01-1049.11 can also instruct the system to notify them when the status of a H01-1049.12 changes or when a H01-1049.13 is complete. We have demonstrated this capability in several field exercises with the Marines and are currently developing applications of this technology in H01-1049.14 .
In this paper, we address the problem of combining several H01-1058.1 . We find that simple H01-1058.2 , like H01-1058.3 , improve the H01-1058.4 but fall short of the H01-1058.5 of an H01-1058.6 . The H01-1058.7 knows the H01-1058.8 and selects the H01-1058.9 with the best H01-1058.10 (typically, H01-1058.11 ) from a list of H01-1058.12 , where each H01-1058.13 has been obtained by using a different H01-1058.14 . Actually, the H01-1058.15 acts like a H01-1058.16 with H01-1058.17 using the H01-1058.18 . We provide experimental results that clearly show the need for a H01-1058.19 to improve the H01-1058.20 further . We suggest a method that mimics the behavior of the H01-1058.21 using a H01-1058.22 or a H01-1058.23 . The method amounts to tagging H01-1058.24 with H01-1058.25 and picking the best H01-1058.26 corresponding to the H01-1058.27 with the best H01-1058.28 .
This paper proposes a practical approach employing H01-1070.1 and H01-1070.2 for H01-1070.3 and H01-1070.4 . The paper also proposes H01-1070.5 applying H01-1070.6 to reduce the H01-1070.7 . Our algorithm reported more than 99% H01-1070.8 in both H01-1070.9 and H01-1070.10 .
N01-1003.1 is a set of inter-related but distinct tasks, one of which is N01-1003.2 , i.e. the choice of N01-1003.3 for elementary N01-1003.4 and the decision of how to combine them into one or more N01-1003.5 . In this paper, we present N01-1003.6 , a N01-1003.7 , and a new methodology for automatically training N01-1003.8 on the basis of N01-1003.9 provided by N01-1003.10 . We reconceptualize the task into two distinct phases. First, a very simple, N01-1003.11 generates a potentially large list of possible N01-1003.12 for a given N01-1003.13 . Second, the N01-1003.14 ranks the list of output N01-1003.15 , and then selects the top-ranked N01-1003.16 . The N01-1003.17 uses N01-1003.18 automatically learned from N01-1003.19 . We show that the trained N01-1003.20 learns to select a N01-1003.21 whose rating on average is only 5% worse than the N01-1003.22 .
In this paper, we compare the relative effects of P01-1004.1 , P01-1004.2 and P01-1004.3 on the P01-1004.4 of a P01-1004.5 . We take a selection of both P01-1004.6 , and run each over both P01-1004.7 , in combination with a range of P01-1004.8 (in the form of P01-1004.9 ). Over two distinct P01-1004.10 , we find that P01-1004.11 according to simple P01-1004.12 produces a P01-1004.13 superior to any of the tested P01-1004.14 . Further,in their optimum P01-1004.15 , P01-1004.16 are shown to be equivalent to P01-1004.17 in terms of P01-1004.18 , but much faster. We also provide evidence that our findings are scalable.
The theoretical study of the P01-1007.1 has revealed many attractive properties which may be used in P01-1007.2 . In particular, P01-1007.3 can be parsed in P01-1007.4 and many classical P01-1007.5 can be translated into equivalent P01-1007.6 without increasing their P01-1007.7 . For example, after P01-1007.8 into an equivalent P01-1007.9 , any P01-1007.10 can be parsed in P01-1007.11 . In this paper, we study a P01-1007.12 whose purpose is to improve the practical efficiency of P01-1007.13 . The P01-1007.14 of the P01-1007.15 for a P01-1007.16 are directed by a P01-1007.17 which uses the P01-1007.18 output by a prior P01-1007.19 for a suitable P01-1007.20 . The results of a practical evaluation of this method on a P01-1007.21 are given.
While P01-1008.1 is critical both for P01-1008.2 , current systems use manual or semi-automatic methods to collect P01-1008.3 . We present an P01-1008.4 for P01-1008.5 from a P01-1008.6 of the same P01-1008.7 . Our approach yields P01-1008.8 as well as P01-1008.9 .
This paper presents a P01-1009.1 for a large class of P01-1009.2 called P01-1009.3 , which includes P01-1009.4 , P01-1009.5 , and P01-1009.6 . These P01-1009.7 appear frequently enough in P01-1009.8 to warrant serious P01-1009.9 , yet present P01-1009.10 perform poorly on P01-1009.11 containing them. I show that the P01-1009.12 of a P01-1009.13 can be improved dramatically by incorporating an approximation of the P01-1009.14 that is compatible with the P01-1009.15 's P01-1009.16 . The value of this approach is that as the P01-1009.17 of P01-1009.18 improve, even larger improvements are possible.
We provide a P01-1047.1 of P01-1047.2 , that are P01-1047.3 of P01-1047.4 . Our P01-1047.5 leads to a neat relation to P01-1047.6 , (yielding a treatment of P01-1047.7 ), a P01-1047.8 in a P01-1047.9 , and a P01-1047.10 from P01-1047.11 (based on a P01-1047.12 and P01-1047.13 ). Here we emphasize the connection to P01-1047.14 which can be viewed as a P01-1047.15 of the P01-1047.16 .
P01-1056.1 modules of a P01-1056.2 have recently been proposed, but a fundamental concern is whether the P01-1056.3 of P01-1056.4 produced with P01-1056.5 can compete with P01-1056.6 . In this paper We experimentally evaluate a P01-1056.7 for a P01-1056.8 by eliciting P01-1056.9 . In order to perform an exhaustive comparison, we also evaluate a P01-1056.10 , two P01-1056.11 , and two P01-1056.12 . We show that the P01-1056.13 performs better than the P01-1056.14 and the P01-1056.15 , and as well as the P01-1056.16 .
We describe a set of P01-1070.1 experiments centering on the construction of P01-1070.2 of P01-1070.3 . These P01-1070.4 , which are built from P01-1070.5 of P01-1070.6 , are employed to predict target variables which represent a P01-1070.7 . We report on different aspects of the P01-1070.8 of our P01-1070.9 , including the influence of various P01-1070.10 on P01-1070.11 , and examine the relationships among the target variables.
This paper describes a method for N03-1001.1 that does not require N03-1001.2 of N03-1001.3 . The method combines N03-1001.4 with off-the-shelf N03-1001.5 to give N03-1001.6 that is surprisingly close to what can be achieved using conventional N03-1001.7 requiring N03-1001.8 . In our method, N03-1001.9 is first used to train a N03-1001.10 for a particular N03-1001.11 ; the N03-1001.12 of N03-1001.13 with this N03-1001.14 is then passed to a N03-1001.15 . The N03-1001.16 of the method is evaluated on three different N03-1001.17 .
Motivated by the success of N03-1004.1 in N03-1004.2 and other areas of N03-1004.3 , we developed a N03-1004.4 which is based on combining the results from different N03-1004.5 searching for N03-1004.6 in multiple N03-1004.7 . The N03-1004.8 adopt fundamentally different strategies, one utilizing primarily N03-1004.9 and the other adopting N03-1004.10 . We present our N03-1004.11 that combines results from the N03-1004.12 at the N03-1004.13 . Experiments evaluating the effectiveness of our N03-1004.14 show a 35.0% relative improvement over our N03-1004.15 in the number of N03-1004.16 , and a 32.8% improvement according to the N03-1004.17 .
In this paper we present N03-1012.1 , a system for scoring sets of N03-1012.2 on the basis of an N03-1012.3 . We apply our system to the task of N03-1012.4 alternative N03-1012.5 in terms of their N03-1012.6 . We conducted an N03-1012.7 and showed that N03-1012.8 can reliably differentiate between semantically coherent and incoherent N03-1012.9 . An evaluation of our system against the N03-1012.10 shows that, it successfully classifies 73.2% in a N03-1012.11 of 2.284 N03-1012.12 as either coherent or incoherent (given a N03-1012.13 of 54.55%).
We propose a new N03-1017.1 and N03-1017.2 that enables us to evaluate and compare several, previously proposed N03-1017.3 . Within our framework, we carry out a large number of experiments to understand better and explain why N03-1017.4 outperform N03-1017.5 . Our empirical results, which hold for all examined N03-1017.6 , suggest that the highest levels of performance can be obtained through relatively simple means: N03-1017.7 of N03-1017.8 from N03-1017.9 and N03-1017.10 of N03-1017.11 . Surprisingly, learning N03-1017.12 longer than three N03-1017.13 and learning N03-1017.14 from N03-1017.15 does not have a strong impact on performance. Learning only N03-1017.16 degrades the performance of our systems.
In this paper, we introduce a N03-1018.1 that describes an end-to-end process in the N03-1018.2 , progressing from generation of N03-1018.3 through its transformation into the N03-1018.4 of an N03-1018.5 . The N03-1018.6 is designed for use in N03-1018.7 , with a focus on N03-1018.8 the N03-1018.9 of black-box N03-1018.10 in order to make it more useful for N03-1018.11 . We present an implementation of the N03-1018.12 based on N03-1018.13 , demonstrate the N03-1018.14 's ability to significantly reduce N03-1018.15 , and provide evaluation results involving N03-1018.16 of N03-1018.17 from N03-1018.18 .
We present an application of N03-1026.1 for N03-1026.2 to the domain of N03-1026.3 . Our system incorporates a N03-1026.4 for N03-1026.5 , a N03-1026.6 for N03-1026.7 operating on N03-1026.8 , and a N03-1026.9 for N03-1026.10 . Furthermore, we propose the use of standard N03-1026.11 for automatically evaluating the N03-1026.12 quality of N03-1026.13 . An N03-1026.14 of N03-1026.15 quality shows a close correlation between the N03-1026.16 and a N03-1026.17 of generated N03-1026.18 . Overall N03-1026.19 quality of the proposed system is state-of-the-art, with guaranteed N03-1026.20 of the N03-1026.21 due to the use of a N03-1026.22 .
We present a new N03-1033.1 that demonstrates the following ideas: (i) explicit use of both preceding and following N03-1033.2 via a N03-1033.3 , (ii) broad use of N03-1033.4 , including N03-1033.5 , (iii) effective use of N03-1033.6 in N03-1033.7 , and (iv) fine-grained modeling of N03-1033.8 . Using these ideas together, the resulting N03-1033.9 gives a 97.24% N03-1033.10 on the N03-1033.11 , an N03-1033.12 of 4.4% on the best previous single automatically learned N03-1033.13 result.
Sources of N03-2003.1 suitable for N03-2003.2 of N03-2003.3 are limited. In this paper, we show how N03-2003.4 can be supplemented with N03-2003.5 from the N03-2003.6 filtered to match the N03-2003.7 and/or N03-2003.8 of the target N03-2003.9 , but also that it is possible to get bigger performance gains from the N03-2003.10 by using N03-2003.11 of N03-2003.12 .
In order to boost the N03-2006.1 of N03-2006.2 based on a small-sized N03-2006.3 , we use an out-of-domain N03-2006.4 and, in addition, the N03-2006.5 of an in-domain N03-2006.6 . We conducted experiments with an N03-2006.7 . The two N03-2006.8 of the N03-2006.9 and the N03-2006.10 demonstrated the effect of using an out-of-domain N03-2006.11 and the possibility of using the N03-2006.12 .
We describe a simple N03-2015.1 for learning N03-2015.2 by identifying N03-2015.3 in an N03-2015.4 . For our purposes, a N03-2015.5 is a N03-2015.6 in a N03-2015.7 with N03-2015.8 greater than one and N03-2015.9 greater than one. We create a N03-2015.10 , transform it into a N03-2015.11 , then identify N03-2015.12 . Those N03-2015.13 mark the boundary between N03-2015.14 and N03-2015.15 , achieving similar N03-2015.16 to more complex mixtures of techniques.
We present a N03-2017.1 for N03-2017.2 , known as the N03-2017.3 . It requires disjoint N03-2017.4 to be mapped to non-overlapping intervals in the N03-2017.5 . We evaluate the utility of this N03-2017.6 in two different algorithms. The results show that it can provide a significant improvement in N03-2017.7 .
A novel N03-2025.1 to N03-2025.2 using N03-2025.3 and N03-2025.4 is presented. This approach only requires a few N03-2025.5 or N03-2025.6  N03-2025.7 that correspond to the N03-2025.8 for the targeted N03-2025.9 , e.g. he/she/man/woman for N03-2025.10 . The N03-2025.11 is implemented as training two N03-2025.12 . First, N03-2025.13 is used to learn the N03-2025.14 . Then, a N03-2025.15 is trained on a N03-2025.16 automatically tagged by the first N03-2025.17 . The resulting N03-2025.18 approaches N03-2025.19 performance for some N03-2025.20 .
In this paper, we describe a N03-2036.1 for N03-2036.2 that uses a much simpler set of N03-2036.3 than similar N03-2036.4 . The N03-2036.5 are N03-2036.6 - pairs of N03-2036.7 . During N03-2036.8 , we use a N03-2036.9 and a N03-2036.10 . During N03-2036.11 , the N03-2036.12 are learned from N03-2036.13 using an underlying N03-2036.14 . We show experimental results on N03-2036.15 based on N03-2036.16 counts and N03-2036.17 length.
In this paper, we propose a novel N03-3010.1 for N03-3010.2 in a N03-3010.3 . We build this based on both N03-3010.4 and N03-3010.5 . N03-3010.6 provides two strategies for N03-3010.7 and have a high accuracy but little robustness and flexibility. N03-3010.8 is much more robust but less accurate. N03-3010.9 incorporates all the three strategies together and thus can suppress all the shortcomings of different strategies and has all the advantages of the three strategies.
The N03-4010.1 integrates a flexible, N03-4010.2 with a variety of N03-4010.3 to provide an N03-4010.4 on N03-4010.5 . The demonstration will focus on how N03-4010.6 processes N03-4010.7 and retrieves the most likely N03-4010.8 from the given N03-4010.9 . The operation of the system will be explained in depth through browsing the N03-4010.10 of N03-4010.11 created by the system during each N03-4010.12 .
In this paper we present a novel, customizable : P03-1002.1 that takes advantage of P03-1002.2 . We also introduce a new way of automatically identifying P03-1002.3 , which is central to our P03-1002.4 . It is based on: (1) an extended set of P03-1002.5 ; and (2) P03-1002.6 . The experimental results prove our claim that accurate P03-1002.7 enable high quality P03-1002.8 results.
This paper proposes the P03-1005.1 for P03-1005.2 . The P03-1005.3 directly accepts several levels of both P03-1005.4 and their P03-1005.5 , and then efficiently computes the P03-1005.6 of the number of common P03-1005.7 of the P03-1005.8 . We applied the proposed method to P03-1005.9 and P03-1005.10 to evaluate its performance as a P03-1005.11 and a P03-1005.12 . The results of the experiments demonstrate that the P03-1005.13 is superior to other P03-1005.14 and P03-1005.15 .
Previous research has demonstrated the utility of P03-1009.1 in inducing P03-1009.2 from undisambiguated P03-1009.3 . We describe a new approach which involves clustering P03-1009.4 distributions using the P03-1009.5 and P03-1009.6 methods. In contrast to previous work, we particularly focus on clustering P03-1009.7 . A novel P03-1009.8 is proposed which accounts for the effect of P03-1009.9 on the P03-1009.10 , offering us a good insight into the potential and limitations of P03-1009.11  P03-1009.12 .
We apply a P03-1022.1 to P03-1022.2 in P03-1022.3 . Our system deals with P03-1022.4 with P03-1022.5 . We present a set of P03-1022.6 designed for P03-1022.7 in P03-1022.8 and determine the most promising P03-1022.9 . We evaluate the system on twenty P03-1022.10 and show that it compares well to P03-1022.11 .
P03-1030.1 has been regarded as a core technology for the P03-1030.2 of P03-1030.3 . In this paper we formulate P03-1030.4 and P03-1030.5 as P03-1030.6 and hypothesize on the impact of P03-1030.7 and P03-1030.8 on both systems. Motivated by these arguments, we introduce a number of new performance enhancing techniques including P03-1030.9 , new P03-1030.10 and expanded P03-1030.11 . Experimental results validate our hypothesis.
This paper concerns the P03-1031.1 in P03-1031.2 . This process enables the system to understand P03-1031.3 based on the P03-1031.4 of a P03-1031.5 . Since multiple P03-1031.6 for the P03-1031.7 result can be obtained for a P03-1031.8 due to the P03-1031.9 of P03-1031.10 , it is not appropriate to decide on a single P03-1031.11 result after each P03-1031.12 . By holding multiple P03-1031.13 for P03-1031.14 results and resolving the P03-1031.15 as the P03-1031.16 progresses, the P03-1031.17 can be improved. This paper proposes a method for resolving this P03-1031.18 based on P03-1031.19 obtained from P03-1031.20 . Unlike conventional methods that use P03-1031.21 , the proposed method enables easy design of the P03-1031.22 . Experiment results have shown that a system that exploits the proposed method performs sufficiently and that holding multiple P03-1031.23 for P03-1031.24 results is effective.
We address appropriate P03-1033.1 in order to generate P03-1033.2 to each P03-1033.3 in P03-1033.4 . Unlike previous studies that focus on P03-1033.5 's P03-1033.6 or typical kinds of P03-1033.7 , the P03-1033.8 we propose is more comprehensive. Specifically, we set up three dimensions of P03-1033.9 : P03-1033.10 to the system, P03-1033.11 on the P03-1033.12 and the degree of P03-1033.13 . Moreover, the P03-1033.14 are automatically derived by P03-1033.15 using real P03-1033.16 collected by the system. We obtained reasonable P03-1033.17 for all dimensions. P03-1033.18 based on the P03-1033.19 are implemented in P03-1033.20 that has been developed at our laboratory. Experimental evaluation shows that the P03-1033.21 adaptive to P03-1033.22 serve as good guidance for P03-1033.23 without increasing the P03-1033.24 for P03-1033.25 .
This paper presents an P03-1050.1 to building a P03-1050.2 . The P03-1050.3 is based on P03-1050.4 and it uses an P03-1050.5 and a small (10K sentences) P03-1050.6 as its sole P03-1050.7 . No P03-1050.8 is needed after the P03-1050.9 . P03-1050.10 can be used to further improve the P03-1050.11 by allowing it to adapt to a desired P03-1050.12 or P03-1050.13 . Examples and results will be given for P03-1050.14 , but the approach is applicable to any P03-1050.15 that needs P03-1050.16 . Our P03-1050.17 results in 87.5% P03-1050.18 with a state of the art, proprietary P03-1050.19 built using P03-1050.20 , P03-1050.21 , and P03-1050.22 , in addition to an P03-1050.23 . P03-1050.24 using P03-1050.25 indicates an improvement of 22-38% in P03-1050.26 over P03-1050.27 , and 96% of the performance of the proprietary P03-1050.28 above.
We approximate P03-1051.1 by a P03-1051.2 that a P03-1051.3 consists of a sequence of P03-1051.4 in the P03-1051.5  P03-1051.6 (* denotes zero or more occurrences of a P03-1051.7 ). Our method is seeded by a small P03-1051.8 and uses it to bootstrap an P03-1051.9 to build the P03-1051.10 from a large P03-1051.11 . The algorithm uses a P03-1051.12 to determine the most probable P03-1051.13 for a given P03-1051.14 . The P03-1051.15 is initially estimated from a small P03-1051.16 of about 110,000 P03-1051.17 . To improve the P03-1051.18  P03-1051.19 , we use an P03-1051.20 for automatically acquiring new P03-1051.21 from a 155 million P03-1051.22  P03-1051.23 , and re-estimate the P03-1051.24 with the expanded P03-1051.25 and P03-1051.26 . The resulting P03-1051.27 achieves around 97% P03-1051.28 on a P03-1051.29 containing 28,449 P03-1051.30 . We believe this is a state-of-the-art performance and the algorithm can be used for many P03-1051.31 provided that one can create a small P03-1051.32 of the P03-1051.33 of interest.
A central problem of P03-1058.1 is the lack of P03-1058.2 required for P03-1058.3 . In this paper, we evaluate an approach to automatically acquire P03-1058.4 from P03-1058.5 , which are then used for disambiguating the P03-1058.6 in the P03-1058.7 . Our investigation reveals that this P03-1058.8 is promising. On a subset of the most difficult P03-1058.9 , the P03-1058.10 difference between the two approaches is only 14.0%, and the difference could narrow further to 6.5% if we disregard the advantage that P03-1058.11 have in their P03-1058.12 . Our analysis also highlights the importance of the issue of P03-1058.13 in evaluating P03-1058.14 .
We describe the ongoing construction of a large, P03-1068.1 resource as reliable basis for the large-scale P03-1068.2 , e.g. the construction of P03-1068.3 . The backbone of the P03-1068.4 are P03-1068.5 in the P03-1068.6 . We report experiences and evaluate the P03-1068.7 from the first project stage. On this basis, we discuss the problems of P03-1068.8 and P03-1068.9 in P03-1068.10 .
We investigate the P03-1070.1 for P03-1070.2 , and propose a design for P03-1070.3 that relies on both kinds of P03-1070.4 to establish P03-1070.5 in P03-1070.6 . We analyzed P03-1070.7 , P03-1070.8 and P03-1070.9 in the context of a P03-1070.10 . The distribution of P03-1070.11 differed depending on the type of P03-1070.12 being grounded, and the overall pattern reflected a monitoring of lack of P03-1070.13 . Based on these results, we present an P03-1070.14 that uses P03-1070.15 to update P03-1070.16 .
An empirical comparison of P03-2036.1 for P03-2036.2 and P03-2036.3 is presented. We demonstrate that an approximation of P03-2036.4 produces a more effective P03-2036.5 than that of P03-2036.6 . We also investigate the reason for that difference.
The reality of C04-1106.1 is refuted by noone (e.g., I walked is to to walk as I laughed is to to laugh, noted I walked : to walk :: I laughed : to laugh). But C04-1106.2 seem to be quite dubious about C04-1106.3 : they would not be enough numerous to be of any use. We report experiments conducted on a C04-1106.4 to estimate the number of C04-1106.5 among the C04-1106.6 that it contains. We give two estimates, a lower one and a higher one. As an C04-1106.7 must be valid on the level of C04-1106.8 as well as on the level of C04-1106.9 , we relied on the idea that C04-1106.10 should preserve C04-1106.11 to test for similar C04-1106.12 .
N04-1024.1 includes a capability that labels N04-1024.2 in student N04-1024.3 with N04-1024.4 (e.g., N04-1024.5 ). We describe a new system that enhances N04-1024.6 's capability, by evaluating multiple aspects of N04-1024.7 in N04-1024.8 . This system identifies N04-1024.9 of N04-1024.10 based on N04-1024.11 and N04-1024.12 . A N04-1024.13 uses these N04-1024.14 to capture N04-1024.15 due to relatedness to the N04-1024.16 and relatedness between N04-1024.17 . N04-1024.18 is evaluated with N04-1024.19 . Results indicate that the system yields higher performance than a N04-1024.20 on all three aspects.
In this paper, we use the H05-1005.1 in H05-1005.2 to correct errors in H05-1005.3 and thus improve the quality of H05-1005.4 . We consider the case of H05-1005.5 , where the input H05-1005.6 are in H05-1005.7 , and the output H05-1005.8 is in H05-1005.9 . Typically, information that makes it to a H05-1005.10 appears in many different H05-1005.11 in the input H05-1005.12 . Further, the use of multiple H05-1005.13 provides yet more H05-1005.14 , yielding different ways to realize that H05-1005.15 in H05-1005.16 . We demonstrate how errors in the H05-1005.17 of the input H05-1005.18 can be corrected by identifying and generating from such H05-1005.19 , focusing on H05-1005.20 .
This paper presents a H05-1012.1 for H05-1012.2 based on H05-1012.3 . We demonstrate that it is feasible to create H05-1012.4 for problems in H05-1012.5 and that a mixture of H05-1012.6 yields superior H05-1012.7 . The H05-1012.8 used in the H05-1012.9 directly models the H05-1012.10 . Significant improvement over traditional H05-1012.11 is shown as well as improvement on several H05-1012.12 . Performance of the algorithm is contrasted with H05-1012.13 .
This paper presents a H05-1095.1 , based on H05-1095.2 , i.e. H05-1095.3 with gaps. A method for producing such H05-1095.4 from a H05-1095.5 is proposed. A H05-1095.6 is also presented that deals such H05-1095.7 , as well as a H05-1095.8 based on the maximization of H05-1095.9 , as measured with the H05-1095.10 . H05-1095.11 are produced by means of a H05-1095.12 . Experimental results are presented, that demonstrate how the proposed method allows to better generalize from the H05-1095.13 .
Following recent developments in the H05-1117.1 of H05-1117.2 and H05-1117.3 , we present a similar approach, implemented in a measure called H05-1117.4 , for H05-1117.5 . Until now, the only way to assess the correctness of answers to such questions involves manual determination of whether an information nugget appears in a system's response. The lack of automatic methods for H05-1117.6 is an impediment to progress in the field, which we address with this work. Experiments with the H05-1117.7 indicate that H05-1117.8 produced by our metric correlate highly with H05-1117.9 , and that H05-1117.10 outperforms direct application of existing metrics.
We describe a method for identifying systematic H05-2007.1 in H05-2007.2 using H05-2007.3 . We incorporate this analysis into a H05-2007.4 intended for H05-2007.5 of H05-2007.6 , and demonstrate how our application can be used by H05-2007.7 to explore H05-2007.8 in H05-2007.9 .
We present the first known I05-2021.1 of an increasingly common speculative claim, by evaluating a representative I05-2021.2 directly on I05-2021.3 , using standard I05-2021.4 and I05-2021.5 from the I05-2021.6 . Much effort has been put in designing and evaluating dedicated I05-2021.7 , in particular with the I05-2021.8 series of workshops. At the same time, the recent improvements in the I05-2021.9 of I05-2021.10 suggests that I05-2021.11 are good at predicting the right I05-2021.12 of the I05-2021.13 in I05-2021.14 . Surprisingly however, the I05-2021.15  I05-2021.16 of I05-2021.17 has never been evaluated and compared with that of the dedicated I05-2021.18 . We present controlled experiments showing the I05-2021.19  I05-2021.20 of current typical I05-2021.21 to be significantly lower than that of all the dedicated I05-2021.22 considered. This tends to support the view that despite recent speculative claims to the contrary, current I05-2021.23 do have limitations in comparison with dedicated I05-2021.24 , and that I05-2021.25 should benefit from the better predictions made by the I05-2021.26 .
I05-2048.1 is currently one of the hot spots in I05-2048.2 . Over the last few years dramatic improvements have been made, and a number of comparative evaluations have shown, that I05-2048.3 gives competitive results to I05-2048.4 , requiring significantly less development time. This is particularly important when building I05-2048.5 for new I05-2048.6 or new I05-2048.7 . This workshop is intended to give an introduction to I05-2048.8 with a focus on practical considerations. Participants should be able, after attending this workshop, to set out building an I05-2048.9 themselves and achieving good I05-2048.10 in a short time. The tutorial will cover the basics of I05-2048.11 : Theory will be put into practice. I05-2048.12 , a I05-2048.13 , will be introduced and used to build a working I05-2048.14 . I05-2048.15 has been developed by the presenter and co-workers over a number of years and is currently used as the basis of I05-2048.16 . It has also successfully been coupled with I05-2048.17 to build a I05-2048.18 . The I05-2048.19 of the I05-2048.20 will be made available.
In this paper we present our recent work on harvesting I05-4010.1 of the laws of Hong Kong from the I05-4010.2 and aligning them to the I05-4010.3 level via utilizing the I05-4010.4 in the I05-4010.5 . Basic methodology and practical techniques are reported in detail. The resultant I05-4010.6 , 10.4M I05-4010.7 and 18.3M I05-4010.8 , is an authoritative and comprehensive I05-4010.9 covering the specific and special domain of HK laws. It is particularly valuable to I05-4010.10 . This piece of work has also laid a foundation for exploring and harvesting I05-4010.11 in a larger volume from the I05-4010.12 .
The task of I05-5003.1 is closely related to the task of I05-5003.2 . This paper investigates the utility of applying standard I05-5003.3 to building I05-5003.4 to predict I05-5003.5 and I05-5003.6 . We also introduce a novel I05-5003.7 based on I05-5003.8 which leverages I05-5003.9 of the I05-5003.10 contributing to the I05-5003.11 in the I05-5003.12 . Our results show that I05-5003.13 are able to produce useful I05-5003.14 for I05-5003.15 and to a lesser extent I05-5003.16 . Our I05-5003.17 gives a substantial improvement in I05-5003.18 over all of the other I05-5003.19 used in the experiments.
We propose a method that automatically generates I05-5008.1 sets from I05-5008.2 to be used as I05-5008.3 in objective I05-5008.4 like I05-5008.5 and I05-5008.6 . We measured the quality of the I05-5008.7 produced in an experiment, i.e., (i) their I05-5008.8 : at least 99% correct I05-5008.9 ; (ii) their I05-5008.10 : at least 96% correct I05-5008.11 either by I05-5008.12 or I05-5008.13 ; and, (iii) the amount of internal I05-5008.14 in a set of I05-5008.15 : slightly superior to that of I05-5008.16 . The I05-5008.17 sets produced by this method thus seem adequate as I05-5008.18 to be used for I05-5008.19 .
This paper proposes an I05-6011.1 that encodes I05-6011.2 (respectful words). I05-6011.3 are used extensively in I05-6011.4 , reflecting the social relationship (e.g. social ranks and age) of the I05-6011.5 . This I05-6011.6 is vital for resolving I05-6011.7 and improving I05-6011.8 . Annotating I05-6011.9 is a complex task that involves identifying a I05-6011.10 with I05-6011.11 , assigning I05-6011.12 to I05-6011.13 of the I05-6011.14 , calibrating the I05-6011.15 , and connecting I05-6011.16 with their I05-6011.17 .
This article considers approaches which rerank the output of an existing J05-1003.1 . The base J05-1003.2 produces a set of J05-1003.3 for each input J05-1003.4 , with associated J05-1003.5 that define an initial J05-1003.6 of these J05-1003.7 . A second J05-1003.8 then attempts to improve upon this initial J05-1003.9 , using additional J05-1003.10 of the J05-1003.11 as evidence. The strength of our approach is that it allows a J05-1003.12 to be represented as an arbitrary set of J05-1003.13 , without concerns about how these J05-1003.14 interact or overlap and without the need to define a J05-1003.15 or a J05-1003.16 which takes these J05-1003.17 into account . We introduce a new method for the J05-1003.18 , based on the J05-1003.19 to J05-1003.20 described in Freund et al. (1998). We apply the J05-1003.21 to J05-1003.22 the J05-1003.23 . The method combined the J05-1003.24 under a J05-1003.25 (that of Collins [1999]) with evidence from an additional 500,000 J05-1003.26 over J05-1003.27 that were not included in the original J05-1003.28 . The new J05-1003.29 achieved 89.75% J05-1003.30 , a 13% relative decrease in J05-1003.31 error over the J05-1003.32 of 88.2%. The article also introduces a new algorithm for the J05-1003.33 which takes advantage of the J05-1003.34 in the J05-1003.35 . Experiments show significant efficiency gains for the new algorithm over the obvious J05-1003.36 of the J05-1003.37 . We argue that the method is an appealing alternative - in terms of both simplicity and efficiency - to work on J05-1003.38 within J05-1003.39 . Although the experiments in this article are on J05-1003.40 , the approach should be applicable to many other J05-1003.41 which are naturally framed as J05-1003.42 , for example, J05-1003.43 , J05-1003.44 , or J05-1003.45 .
<SectionTitle /> We present a novel method for J05-4003.1 in J05-4003.2 . We train a J05-4003.3 that, given a pair of J05-4003.4 , can reliably determine whether or not they are J05-4003.5 of each other. Using this approach, we extract J05-4003.6 from large J05-4003.7 . We evaluate the J05-4003.8 by showing that it improves the performance of a state-of-the-art J05-4003.9 . We also show that a good-quality J05-4003.10 can be built from scratch by starting with a very small J05-4003.11 (100,000 J05-4003.12 ) and exploiting a large J05-4003.13 . Thus, our method can be applied with great benefit to J05-4003.14 for which only scarce J05-4003.15 are available.
In this paper we describe a novel P05-1032.1 for P05-1032.2 which allows for the P05-1032.3 of arbitrarily long P05-1032.4 while simultaneously using less P05-1032.5 than is required by current P05-1032.6 implementations. We detail the P05-1032.7 and P05-1032.8 for looking up P05-1032.9 in our P05-1032.10 . We show how P05-1032.11 can be used to reduce the P05-1032.12 by orders of magnitude with no loss in P05-1032.13 .
We describe a novel approach to P05-1034.1 that combines P05-1034.2 in the P05-1034.3 with recent advances in P05-1034.4 . This method requires a P05-1034.5  P05-1034.6 , P05-1034.7  P05-1034.8 and an P05-1034.9 . We align a P05-1034.10 , project the P05-1034.11 onto the target P05-1034.12 , extract P05-1034.13 , and train a P05-1034.14 . We describe an efficient P05-1034.15 and show that using these P05-1034.16 in combination with conventional P05-1034.17 provides a promising approach that incorporates the power of P05-1034.18 with the linguistic generality available in a P05-1034.19 .
We directly investigate a subject of much recent debate: do P05-1048.1 help P05-1048.2  P05-1048.3 ? We present empirical results casting doubt on this common, but unproved, assumption. Using a state-of-the-art P05-1048.4 to choose P05-1048.5 for a typical P05-1048.6 , we find that P05-1048.7 does not yield significantly better P05-1048.8 than the P05-1048.9 alone. P05-1048.10 suggests several key factors behind this surprising finding, including inherent limitations of current P05-1048.11 .
P05-1067.1 aims at applying P05-1067.2 to P05-1067.3 . In this paper, we present a P05-1067.4 based on a P05-1067.5 . P05-1067.6 are a version of P05-1067.7 defined on P05-1067.8 . We first introduce our approach to inducing such a P05-1067.9 from P05-1067.10 . Second, we describe the P05-1067.11 for the P05-1067.12 , which can also be viewed as a P05-1067.13 . We introduce a P05-1067.14 for the P05-1067.15 . We evaluate the outputs of our P05-1067.16 using the P05-1067.17 . The result shows that our system outperforms the P05-1067.18 based on the P05-1067.19 in both P05-1067.20 .
In this paper, we present a novel P05-1069.1 for a P05-1069.2 for P05-1069.3 . The P05-1069.4 predicts P05-1069.5 with orientation to handle P05-1069.6 . We use a P05-1069.7 to train a P05-1069.8 which uses P05-1069.9 (e.g. a P05-1069.10 ) as well as P05-1069.11 based on the P05-1069.12 identities themselves, e.g. block bigram features. Our P05-1069.13 can easily handle millions of P05-1069.14 . The best system obtains a 18.6% improvement over the P05-1069.15 on a standard P05-1069.16 .
Previous work has used P05-1074.1 to extract and generate P05-1074.2 . We show that this task can be done using P05-1074.3 , a much more commonly available P05-1074.4 . Using P05-1074.5 from P05-1074.6 , we show how P05-1074.7 in one P05-1074.8 can be identified using a P05-1074.9 in another language as a pivot. We define a P05-1074.10 that allows P05-1074.11 extracted from a P05-1074.12 to be ranked using P05-1074.13 , and show how it can be refined to take P05-1074.14 into account. We evaluate our P05-1074.15 using a set of P05-1074.16 , and contrast the P05-1074.17 with P05-1074.18 extracted from P05-1074.19 .
We present a P05-2016.1 which performs P05-2016.2 of P05-2016.3 . The only P05-2016.4 required is a P05-2016.5 . All other P05-2016.6 are P05-2016.7 . We also refer to an P05-2016.8 and plan to compare our P05-2016.9 with a P05-2016.10 .
In this paper a novel solution to automatic and E06-1018.1 is introduced. It represents an instantiation of the E06-1018.2 (Gale et al., 1992). Like most existing approaches it utilizes E06-1018.3 . This approach differs from other approaches to E06-1018.4 in that it enhances the effect of the E06-1018.5 by using triplets of E06-1018.6 instead of pairs. The combination with a E06-1018.7 using E06-1018.8 as E06-1018.9 allows for accurate results. Additionally, a novel and likewise automatic and E06-1018.10 inspired by Schutze's (1992) idea of evaluation of E06-1018.11 is employed. Offering advantages like reproducability and independency of a given biased E06-1018.12 it also enables E06-1018.13 of the E06-1018.14 .
We present results on E06-1022.1 in E06-1022.2 using E06-1022.3 and E06-1022.4 . First, we investigate how well the E06-1022.5 of a E06-1022.6 can be predicted based on E06-1022.7 , E06-1022.8 and E06-1022.9 . Then, we explore whether information about E06-1022.10 can aid E06-1022.11 ' E06-1022.12 . Both E06-1022.13 perform the best when E06-1022.14 and E06-1022.15 are combined with E06-1022.16 . The E06-1022.17 show little E06-1022.18 from information about E06-1022.19 .
Most state-of-the-art E06-1031.1 for E06-1031.2 assign high E06-1031.3 to movements of E06-1031.4 blocks. In many cases though such movements still result in correct or almost correct E06-1031.5 . In this paper, we will present a new E06-1031.6 which explicitly models E06-1031.7 as an E06-1031.8 . Our E06-1031.9 can be exactly calculated in E06-1031.10 . Furthermore, we will show how some E06-1031.11 can be improved by the introduction of E06-1031.12 . The correlation of the new E06-1031.13 with E06-1031.14 has been investigated systematically on two different E06-1031.15 . The experimental results will show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in E06-1031.16 . Results from experiments with E06-1031.17 will demonstrate an additional increase of correlation between E06-1031.18 and E06-1031.19 .
In this paper, we investigate the problem of automatically predicting E06-1035.1 in E06-1035.2 . We extend prior work in two ways. We first apply approaches that have been proposed for E06-1035.3 to the problem of E06-1035.4 . We then explore the impact on E06-1035.5 of using E06-1035.6 as opposed to E06-1035.7 . Examination of the effect of E06-1035.8 shows that E06-1035.9 are two distinct tasks: (1) for predicting E06-1035.10 , the E06-1035.11 alone can achieve competitive results, (2) for E06-1035.12 , the E06-1035.13 that combines E06-1035.14 performs best, and (3) E06-1035.15 , such as E06-1035.16 and E06-1035.17 , are better indicators for the top-level prediction task. We also find that the E06-1035.18 inevitable in E06-1035.19 have a negative impact on models that combine E06-1035.20 , but do not change the general preference of approach for the two tasks.
P06-1013.1 are an effective way of improving P06-1013.2 . This paper examines the benefits of P06-1013.3 for P06-1013.4 . We investigate several P06-1013.5 over a diverse pool of P06-1013.6 . Our P06-1013.7 rely on P06-1013.8 which are derived automatically from P06-1013.9 . Experiments using the P06-1013.10 and P06-1013.11 demonstrate that our ensembles yield significantly better results when compared with state-of-the-art.
We present an efficient algorithm for the P06-1052.1 : Given an P06-1052.2 of a P06-1052.3 , compute an P06-1052.4 with fewer mutually P06-1052.5 . The algorithm operates on P06-1052.6 which are derived from P06-1052.7 ; it can be applied to the P06-1052.8 computed by P06-1052.9 . We evaluate the algorithm on a P06-1052.10 , and show that it reduces the degree of P06-1052.11 significantly while taking negligible runtime.
In this paper, we describe the research using P06-2001.1 to build a P06-2001.2 to be integrated in a P06-2001.3 for P06-2001.4 . After several experiments, and trained with a little P06-2001.5 of 100,000 P06-2001.6 , the system guesses correctly not placing P06-2001.7 with a P06-2001.8 of 96% and a P06-2001.9 of 98%. It also gets a P06-2001.10 of 70% and a P06-2001.11 of 49% in the task of placing P06-2001.12 . Finally, we have shown that these results can be improved using a bigger and a more homogeneous P06-2001.13 to train, that is, a bigger P06-2001.14 written by one unique P06-2001.15 .
This paper presents an P06-2012.1 to disambiguate various relations between P06-2012.2 by use of various P06-2012.3 from the P06-2012.4 . It works by calculating P06-2012.5 of an P06-2012.6 's P06-2012.7 to recover a P06-2012.8 of data from a P06-2012.9 and then performing P06-2012.10 on the P06-2012.11 . Experiment results on P06-2012.12 show that this P06-2012.13 outperforms the other P06-2012.14 .
This paper proposes a novel method of building P06-2059.1 from P06-2059.2 . The characteristics of this method is that it is fully automatic and can be applied to arbitrary P06-2059.3 . The idea behind our method is to utilize certain P06-2059.4 and P06-2059.5 . By using them, we can automatically extract such P06-2059.6 that express opinion. In our experiment, the method could construct a P06-2059.7 consisting of 126,610 P06-2059.8 .
In this paper we show how two standard outputs from H01-1040.1 - H01-1040.2 and H01-1040.3 - can be used to enhance access to H01-1040.4 via a standard H01-1040.5 . We describe how this information is used in a H01-1040.6 designed to support H01-1040.7 ' access to a H01-1040.8 as part of their H01-1040.9 function. We also report results of a preliminary, H01-1040.10 of the system, which while broadly positive indicates further work needs to be done on the H01-1040.11 to make H01-1040.12 aware of the increased potential of H01-1040.13 .
Recent advances in H01-1055.1 have put the goal of naturally sounding H01-1055.2 within reach. However, the improved H01-1055.3 has brought to light a new problem: as H01-1055.4 understand more of what the H01-1055.5 tells them, they need to be more sophisticated at responding to the H01-1055.6 . The issue of H01-1055.7 to H01-1055.8 has been extensively studied by the H01-1055.9 , though rarely in the context of H01-1055.10 . We show how research in H01-1055.11 can be adapted to H01-1055.12 , and how the high cost of hand-crafting H01-1055.13 can be overcome by employing H01-1055.14 .
We describe a three-tiered approach for evaluation of H01-1068.1 . The three tiers measure H01-1068.2 , H01-1068.3 and H01-1068.4 . We describe our use of this approach in numerous fielded H01-1068.5 conducted with the U.S. military.
The N03-4004.1 is an application designed to help an N03-4004.2 -speaking analyst write a N03-4004.3 , culling information from a large inflow of N03-4004.4 . It gives users the ability to spend their time finding more data relevant to their task, and gives them translingual reach into other N03-4004.5 by leveraging N03-4004.6 .
This paper investigates some H05-1101.1 associated with H05-1101.2 that have recently been adopted in the literature on H05-1101.3 . These H05-1101.4 can be viewed as pairs of H05-1101.5 working in a 'synchronous' way. Two H05-1101.6 results for the class H05-1101.7 are reported, along with an H05-1101.8 for certain classes of algorithms that are currently used in the literature.
Automatic I05-2014.1 for I05-2014.2 , such as I05-2014.3 or I05-2014.4 , are now well established. Yet, they are scarcely used for the assessment of I05-2014.5 like I05-2014.6 or I05-2014.7 , because of the I05-2014.8 . This study establishes the equivalence between the standard use of I05-2014.9 in I05-2014.10 and its application at the I05-2014.11 level. The use of I05-2014.12 at the I05-2014.13 level eliminates the I05-2014.14 : it makes it possible to directly compare commercial systems outputting I05-2014.15 with, for instance, I05-2014.16 which usually segment their I05-2014.17 .
This paper describes a method of P05-3025.1 of P05-3025.2 . The method allows a P05-3025.3 to explore a P05-3025.4 of P05-3025.5 , to understand the P05-3025.6 's strengths and weaknesses, and to compare it to other P05-3025.7 . Using this P05-3025.8 , we can find and address conceptual and practical problems in an P05-3025.9 . In our demonstration at P05-3025.10 , new P05-3025.11 of our tool will drive a P05-3025.12 for themselves.
In this paper we study a set of problems that are of considerable importance to E06-1004.1 but which have not been addressed satisfactorily by the E06-1004.2 . Over the last decade, a variety of E06-1004.3 have been built and empirically tested whereas little is known about the E06-1004.4 of some of the fundamental problems of E06-1004.5 . Our work aims at providing useful insights into the the E06-1004.6 of those problems. We prove that while E06-1004.7 are conceptually and computationally simple, computations involving the higher (and more useful) E06-1004.8 are E06-1004.9 . Since it is unlikely that there exists a E06-1004.10 for any of these E06-1004.11 (unless E06-1004.12 and E06-1004.13 ), our results highlight and justify the need for developing E06-1004.14 for these computations. We also discuss some practical ways of dealing with E06-1004.15 .
This paper discusses two problems that arise in the E06-1041.1 of E06-1041.2 : (a) E06-1041.3 , such as size or location; (b) E06-1041.4 in E06-1041.5 . Both problems, it is argued, can be resolved if some structure is imposed on the available knowledge prior to E06-1041.6 . We describe a E06-1041.7 which is sufficiently general to be applied to these diverse problems, discuss its application, and evaluate its performance.
State-of-the-art N06-2009.1 are very sensitive to variations in the phrasing of an N06-2009.2 . Finding the preferred N06-2009.3 for such a N06-2009.4 is a valuable task. We investigate that claim by adopting a simple N06-2009.5 and evaluating N06-2009.6 performance on N06-2009.7 . We found a potential increase of 35% in N06-2009.8 with respect to the original N06-2009.9 .
There are several approaches that model N06-2038.1 as a N06-2038.2 , using various N06-2038.3 to combine multiple N06-2038.4 . We describe the N06-2038.5 that can be found in the literature and evaluate their relative performances. We also introduce a new strategy, called N06-2038.6 or N06-2038.7 , and show that it is competitive to the best other strategies.
We introduce a new N06-4001.1 called N06-4001.2 . N06-4001.3 aims at making N06-4001.4 accessible to researchers who are not experts in N06-4001.5 . As evidence of its usefulness and usability, it has been used successfully in a research context to uncover relationships between N06-4001.6 and N06-4001.7 in two distinct domains: N06-4001.8 (Kumar et al., submitted) and N06-4001.9 (Arguello et al., 2006). As an N06-4001.10 , it has been used as part of a unit on N06-4001.11 in an N06-4001.12 .
This paper proposes a generic P06-1018.1 for the combination of various P06-1018.2 : P06-1018.3 , P06-1018.4 , P06-1018.5 , P06-1018.6 , and products of them. The P06-1018.7 of the objects of the P06-1018.8 controls the P06-1018.9 of the final P06-1018.10 . This formalism is both elementary and powerful enough to strongly simulate many P06-1018.11 , such as P06-1018.12 , P06-1018.13 , P06-1018.14 , P06-1018.15 and P06-1018.16 .
This paper examines what kind of P06-2110.1 between P06-2110.2 can be represented by what kind of P06-2110.3 in the P06-2110.4 . Through two experiments, three P06-2110.5 , i.e., P06-2110.6 , were compared in terms of the ability to represent two kinds of P06-2110.7 , i.e., P06-2110.8 and P06-2110.9 . The result of the comparison was that the P06-2110.10 better reflect P06-2110.11 , while the P06-2110.12 better reflect P06-2110.13 .
We investigate independent and relevant event-based extractive P06-3007.1 . In this paper, P06-3007.2 are defined as P06-3007.3 and P06-3007.4 . With independent approach, we identify important P06-3007.5 by frequency of P06-3007.6 . With relevant approach, we identify important contents by P06-3007.7 on the P06-3007.8 constructed from P06-3007.9 . Experimental results are encouraging.
This paper describes P06-4007.1 , an P06-4007.2 designed to address the challenges of integrating P06-4007.3 applications into real-world environments. P06-4007.4 utilizes a novel approach to P06-4007.5 known as P06-4007.6 which attempts to identify the P06-4007.7 (and P06-4007.8 ) that P06-4007.9 need by analyzing how a P06-4007.10 interacts with a system while gathering information related to a particular scenario.
This paper introduces a method for P06-4011.1 in P06-4011.2 of P06-4011.3 . In our approach, P06-4011.4 in a given P06-4011.5 are analyzed and labeled with a specific P06-4011.6 in light of various P06-4011.7 . The method involves automatically gathering a large number of P06-4011.8 from the P06-4011.9 and building a P06-4011.10 of P06-4011.11 . We also present a prototype P06-4011.12 , P06-4011.13 , which exploits the P06-4011.14 for P06-4011.15 . This system provides a promising approach to P06-4011.16 .
The P06-4014.1 assembles independently valuable P06-4014.2 into a P06-4014.3 that capitalizes on P06-4014.4 . The demonstrator embodies an interesting combination of P06-4014.5 and P06-4014.6 .
A research program is described in which a particular T78-1001.1 is tested as broadly as possible. In this format, developed by the LNR research group at The University of California at San Diego, T78-1001.2 are represented as interconnected sets of T78-1001.3 . These T78-1001.4 may be thought of as the almost inevitable T78-1001.5 that a T78-1001.6 makes when a T78-1001.7 is used in a T78-1001.8 . They confer a T78-1001.9 on the T78-1001.10 in which the T78-1001.11 is used.
The paper outlines a T78-1028.1 of T78-1028.2 constructed from analysis of people's answers to everyday questions. Like T78-1028.3 , the T78-1028.4 is expressed in a T78-1028.5 . Unlike T78-1028.6 , the T78-1028.7 specifies how different information in T78-1028.8 affects the certainty of the conclusions drawn. The T78-1028.9 consists of a T78-1028.10 of different T78-1028.11 and their T78-1028.12 , including a variety of T78-1028.13 where the T78-1028.14 depends on the person's knowledge about his own knowledge. The protocols from people's answers to questions are analyzed in terms of the different T78-1028.15 . The paper also discusses how T78-1028.16 is structured in multiple ways to support the different T78-1028.17 , and how the information found in T78-1028.18 determines which T78-1028.19 are triggered.
Two styles of performing T78-1031.1 in T78-1031.2 are presented and compared. T78-1031.3 allows an T78-1031.4 or a T78-1031.5 between two given T78-1031.6 to be inferred from the existence of another specified T78-1031.7 between the same two T78-1031.8 . T78-1031.9 may be written using a T78-1031.10 . T78-1031.11 allows a T78-1031.12 of T78-1031.13 to be inferred from the existence of an instance of a pattern of T78-1031.14 . T78-1031.15 can be constructed in a T78-1031.16 using a variant of a T78-1031.17 . T78-1031.18 is more efficient, while T78-1031.19 is more general. A method is described of combining the two styles in a single system in order to take advantage of the strengths of each. Applications of T78-1031.20 to the representation of the T78-1031.21 of T78-1031.22 , and to the T78-1031.23 of T78-1031.24 in T78-1031.25 are sketched.
In order to meet the needs of a publication of papers in English, many systems to run off texts have been developed. In this paper, we report a system C80-1039.1 which can make a fair copy of not only texts but also graphs and tables indispensable to our papers. Its selection of C80-1039.2 , specification of C80-1039.3 size are dynamically changeable, and the C80-1039.4 can be also changed in lateral or longitudinal directions. Each C80-1039.5 has its own width and a line length is counted by the sum of each C80-1039.6 . By using commands or C80-1039.7 which are defined to facilitate the construction of format expected or some C80-1039.8 , elaborate and pretty documents can be successfully obtained.
An attempt has been made to use an C80-1073.1 as a procedural C80-1073.2 . The development of such a C80-1073.3 appears to be important in several respects: as a device to represent and to use different C80-1073.4 proposed in empirical C80-1073.5 ; as a device to represent and to use C80-1073.6 ; as a device combining knowledge about C80-1073.7 and about C80-1073.8 with knowledge about C80-1073.9 . A standard C80-1073.10 should be further developed in order to account for the C80-1073.11 of C80-1073.12 .
Interpreting P80-1004.1 is an integral and inescapable process in P80-1004.2 . This paper discusses a P80-1004.3 based on the existence of a small number of P80-1004.4 . Each P80-1004.5 contains a P80-1004.6 , a P80-1004.7 , additional P80-1004.8 , and an P80-1004.9 . It is argued that the method reduces P80-1004.10 from a P80-1004.11 to a P80-1004.12 . Implications towards automating certain aspects of P80-1004.13 are also discussed.
Current P80-1019.1 have concentrated largely on determining the literal P80-1019.2 of P80-1019.3 from their P80-1019.4 . While such P80-1019.5 is an essential underpinning, much recent work suggests that P80-1019.6 will never appear cooperative or graceful unless they also incorporate numerous P80-1019.7 , such as robust P80-1019.8 . This paper defends that view, but claims that direct imitation of human performance is not the best way to implement many of these P80-1019.9 ; that the new technology of powerful P80-1019.10 with integral P80-1019.11 offers techniques superior to those of humans for these aspects, while still satisfying P80-1019.12 . The paper proposes P80-1019.13 based on a judicious mixture of these techniques and the still valuable methods of more traditional P80-1019.14 .
When people use P80-1026.1 in natural settings, they often use it ungrammatically, missing out or repeating words, breaking-off and restarting, speaking in fragments, etc.. Their P80-1026.2 are usually able to cope with these deviations with little difficulty. If a P80-1026.3 wishes to accept P80-1026.4 from its P80-1026.5 on a routine basis, it must display a similar indifference. In this paper, we outline a set of P80-1026.6 that such a system should provide. We go, on to describe P80-1026.7 , a P80-1026.8 that we have designed and implemented to provide these flexibilities for P80-1026.9 input to a limited-domain computer system.
This paper proposes a series of modifications to the C82-1054.1 for C82-1054.2 . It is argued that the resulting algorithm is both efficient and flexible and is, therefore, a good choice for the C82-1054.3 used in a C82-1054.4 .
This paper gives an overall account of a prototype J82-3002.1 , called J82-3002.2 . J82-3002.3 has been designed to be both efficient and easily adaptable to a variety of applications. The system is implemented entirely in J82-3002.4 , a J82-3002.5 based on J82-3002.6 . With the aid of a J82-3002.7 called J82-3002.8 , J82-3002.9 translates J82-3002.10 into the J82-3002.11  J82-3002.12 . The resulting J82-3002.13 is then transformed by a J82-3002.14 into efficient J82-3002.15 , cf. J82-3002.16 in a J82-3002.17 . Finally, the J82-3002.18 is executed to yield the answer.
Most large P82-1035.1 have been designed under the assumption that the input P82-1035.2 will be in reasonably neat form, e.g., P82-1035.3 and other P82-1035.4 . However, a great deal of P82-1035.5 e.g., P82-1035.6 , rough P82-1035.7 , P82-1035.8 etc., have features that differ significantly from P82-1035.9 , posing special problems for readers, such as P82-1035.10 , P82-1035.11 , P82-1035.12 , P82-1035.13 , etc. Our solution to these problems is to make use of P82-1035.14 , based both on knowledge of P82-1035.15 and on P82-1035.16 of the situation being described. These P82-1035.17 can be used to figure out P82-1035.18 from P82-1035.19 , constrain the possible P82-1035.20 of P82-1035.21 ( P82-1035.22 ), fill in P82-1035.23 ( P82-1035.24 ), and resolve P82-1035.25 ( P82-1035.26 ). This method of using P82-1035.27 to aid the understanding of P82-1035.28 has been incorporated into a working P82-1035.29 called P82-1035.30 , which understands P82-1035.31 in the domain of Navy messages.
This abstract describes a P84-1020.1 which deals usefully with P84-1020.2 and describes some actual and potential applications of it in P84-1020.3 . However, this is not the only area in which the principles of the system might be used, and the aim in building it was simply to demonstrate the workability of the general mechanism, and provide a framework for assessing developments of it.
A proper treatment of P84-1034.1 and P84-1034.2 in P84-1034.3 is introduced and discussed from the empirical viewpoint. For P84-1034.4 , the P84-1034.5 is effective where the P84-1034.6 and the P84-1034.7 play important roles. For P84-1034.8 , the P84-1034.9 is powerful where the P84-1034.10 and the P84-1034.11 (which is a kind of P84-1034.12 ) play essential roles. Some examples of the difference between P84-1034.13 and P84-1034.14 , which is vital to P84-1034.15 are also discussed together with various interesting P84-1034.16 .
An P84-1047.1 is proposed. In this approach, the definitions of the P84-1047.2 and P84-1047.3 of P84-1047.4 are grouped together. Like P84-1047.5 , this allows easy exploitation of P84-1047.6 . In addition, it facilitates P84-1047.7 and the use of P84-1047.8 , and so is particularly useful for robust P84-1047.9 . Several advantages from the point of view of P84-1047.10 are also noted. Representative samples from an P84-1047.11 are presented, along with a P84-1047.12 for an P84-1047.13 , some P84-1047.14 that use the P84-1047.15 , and worked examples of P84-1047.16 . A P84-1047.17 incorporating the P84-1047.18 and the P84-1047.19 is currently under P84-1047.20 .
Informally, a P84-1064.1 is a P84-1064.2 which is preponderantly, but not necessarily always, true. For example, birds can fly is a P84-1064.3 , as are the P84-1064.4 Swedes are blond and Spaniards are dark. An idea which underlies the theory described in this paper is that a P84-1064.5 may be viewed as a P84-1064.6 with implicit P84-1064.7 which are approximations to all and always, e.g., almost all, almost always, most, frequently, etc. For example, birds can fly may be interpreted as the result of suppressing the P84-1064.8 most in the P84-1064.9 most birds can fly. Similarly, young men like young women may be read as most young men like mostly young women. The process of transforming a P84-1064.10 into a P84-1064.11 is referred to as P84-1064.12 or P84-1064.13 . P84-1064.14 sets the stage for representing the P84-1064.15 of a P84-1064.16 through the use of P84-1064.17 (Zadeh, 1978, 1982). In this approach to P84-1064.18 , the P84-1064.19 of a P84-1064.20 , p, is represented as a procedure which tests, scores and aggregates the elastic constraints which are induced by p. The paper closes with a description of an approach to P84-1064.21 which is based on the concept of a P84-1064.22 . P84-1064.23 has an important bearing on P84-1064.24 as well as on the P84-1064.25 in P84-1064.26 . As a simple application of the techniques described in this paper, we formulate a definition of P84-1064.27 -- a concept which plays an important role in P84-1064.28 and is of relevance to P84-1064.29 .
This report describes P84-1078.1 , a P84-1078.2 designed to create P84-1078.3 through the use of P84-1078.4 . Specifically, this system is designed to deterministically choose between P84-1078.5 , P84-1078.6 , and definite P84-1078.7 . The system identifies a strength of P84-1078.8 for each of the P84-1078.9 , and matches them against the P84-1078.10 of each element in the P84-1078.11 to select the proper P84-1078.12 for these elements.
C86-1081.1 play an important role in conveying the C86-1081.2 of an C86-1081.3 , but they have often been disregarded, perhaps because it seemed more important to devise methods to grasp the C86-1081.4 of a C86-1081.5 , even if not in a precise way. Another problem with C86-1081.6 is their inherent C86-1081.7 . In this paper we propose a C86-1081.8 , which, among other things, is suitable for representing C86-1081.9 without forcing a particular C86-1081.10 when their C86-1081.11 is still not clear.
This paper describes a system ( C86-1132.1 ) which synthesizes marine weather forecasts directly from C86-1132.2 . Such C86-1132.3 appears feasible in certain C86-1132.4 with C86-1132.5 . C86-1132.6 draws on several kinds of C86-1132.7 and mirrors a forecaster's apparent tendency to ascribe less precise C86-1132.8 to more remote meteorological events. The approach can easily be adapted to synthesize C86-1132.9 .
A method for J86-1002.1 of J86-1002.2 is described that acquires J86-1002.3 in typical usage and uses these J86-1002.4 to predict new inputs. J86-1002.5 is done by strongly biasing J86-1002.6 toward expected J86-1002.7 unless clear evidence from the input shows the current J86-1002.8 is not expected. A J86-1002.9 is presented along with a description of its J86-1002.10 in a J86-1002.11 . A series of tests are described that show the power of the J86-1002.12 when J86-1002.13 occurs.
In this paper we explore a new J86-3001.1 that stresses the role of J86-3001.2 and J86-3001.3 in J86-3001.4 . In this theory, J86-3001.5 is composed of three separate but interrelated components: the structure of the sequence of J86-3001.6 (called the J86-3001.7 ), a structure of J86-3001.8 (called the J86-3001.9 ), and the state of J86-3001.10 (called the J86-3001.11 ). The J86-3001.12 consists of segments of the J86-3001.13 into which the J86-3001.14 naturally aggregate. The J86-3001.15 captures the J86-3001.16 , expressed in each of the J86-3001.17 as well as relationships among them. The J86-3001.18 is an abstraction of the J86-3001.19 of the J86-3001.20 as the J86-3001.21 unfolds. The J86-3001.22 , being dynamic, records the objects, properties, and relations that are salient at each point of the J86-3001.23 . The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such J86-3001.24 as J86-3001.25 , J86-3001.26 , and J86-3001.27 . The J86-3001.28 is illustrated in the paper with a number of example J86-3001.29 . Various properties of J86-3001.30 are described, and explanations for the behaviour of J86-3001.31 , J86-3001.32 , and J86-3001.33 are explored. This J86-3001.34 provides a framework for describing the processing of J86-3001.35 in a J86-3001.36 . J86-3001.37 requires recognizing how the J86-3001.38 of the J86-3001.39 aggregate into J86-3001.40 , recognizing the J86-3001.41 expressed in the J86-3001.42 and the relationships among J86-3001.43 , and tracking the J86-3001.44 through the operation of the mechanisms associated with J86-3001.45 . This processing description specifies in these J86-3001.46 the role of information from the J86-3001.47 and from the J86-3001.48 ' knowledge of the domain.
The goal of this work is the enrichment of J86-4002.1 in a J86-4002.2 . Because a J86-4002.3 and J86-4002.4 cannot be assured to have the same J86-4002.5 , J86-4002.6 , J86-4002.7 , J86-4002.8 , or J86-4002.9 , at each point in a J86-4002.10 , difficulties and mistakes arise when a J86-4002.11 interprets a J86-4002.12 . These mistakes can lead to various kinds of misunderstandings between J86-4002.13 and J86-4002.14 , including J86-4002.15 or failure to understand the J86-4002.16 . We call these misunderstandings J86-4002.17 . Such mistakes can slow, and possibly break down, J86-4002.18 . Our goal is to recognize and isolate such J86-4002.19 and circumvent them. This paper highlights a particular class of J86-4002.20 --- J86-4002.21 --- by describing a case study and techniques for avoiding J86-4002.22 . We want to illustrate a framework less restrictive than earlier ones by allowing a J86-4002.23 leeway in forming an J86-4002.24 about a task and in determining the conversational vehicle to deliver it. The paper also promotes a new view for J86-4002.25 .
We examine the relationship between the two P86-1011.1 : P86-1011.2 and P86-1011.3 . We briefly investigate the weak P86-1011.4 of the two P86-1011.5 . We then turn to a discussion comparing the P86-1011.6 of the two P86-1011.7 .
P86-1038.1 use structures containing sets of P86-1038.2 to describe P86-1038.3 . Although P86-1038.4 have been worked out in experimental research, these algorithms become quite complicated, and a more precise description of P86-1038.5 is desirable. We have developed a P86-1038.6 in which descriptions of P86-1038.7 can be regarded as P86-1038.8 , and interpreted by sets of P86-1038.9 which satisfy them. These P86-1038.10 are, in fact, P86-1038.11 for a special type of P86-1038.12 . This P86-1038.13 for P86-1038.14 extends the ideas of Pereira and Shieber [11], by providing an interpretation for values which are specified by P86-1038.15 and P86-1038.16 embedded within P86-1038.17 . Our interpretation differs from that of Pereira and Shieber by using a P86-1038.18 in place of a P86-1038.19 . This P86-1038.20 yields a calculus of P86-1038.21 , which can be used to simplify P86-1038.22 . P86-1038.23 is attractive, because of its generality, but it is often computationally inefficient. Our P86-1038.24 allows a careful examination of the P86-1038.25 of P86-1038.26 . We have shown that the P86-1038.27 for P86-1038.28 with P86-1038.29 is P86-1038.30 . To deal with this P86-1038.31 , we describe how P86-1038.32 values can be specified in a way which delays P86-1038.33 to P86-1038.34 .
This paper describes a domain independent strategy for the A88-1001.1 elicited by a A88-1001.2 to A88-1001.3 . A88-1001.4 include A88-1001.5 and heuristically-produced complete A88-1001.6 in A88-1001.7 or A88-1001.8 . A88-1001.9 and A88-1001.10 about the A88-1001.11 are enabled. The A88-1001.12 thus presents the application as cooperative and conversational.
In this paper, we describe the A88-1003.1 of A88-1003.2 , a portable A88-1003.3 . The design of this module was motivated by the observation that, although there exist many theories of A88-1003.4 , no one of these theories is complete. Thus we have implemented a A88-1003.5 in which individual A88-1003.6 can be encoded as separate modules that can interact to propose candidate A88-1003.7 and to evaluate each other's proposals.
This paper discusses the application of C88-1007.1 to the framework of C88-1007.2 for C88-1007.3 pioneered by Landsbergen. The C88-1007.4 involves developing the C88-1007.5 of the C88-1007.6 in parallel, in order to ensure that C88-1007.7 and C88-1007.8 expressions which stand in the C88-1007.9 have C88-1007.10 . The principle advantage of this approach is that knowledge concerning translation equivalence of expressions may be directly exploited, obviating the need for answers to C88-1007.11 that we do not yet have. C88-1007.12 and other information may still be incorporated, but as constraints on the C88-1007.13 , not as levels of C88-1007.14 . After introducing this approach to C88-1007.15 design, and the basics of C88-1007.16 , we will show how the two can be integrated, and present an example from an implemented C88-1007.17 . Finally we will present some outstanding problems with the approach.
This paper presents necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of C88-1044.1 in C88-1044.2 and discusses implications for current C88-1044.3 . We examine a broad range of C88-1044.4 to show how the distribution of C88-1044.5 is C88-1044.6 . This research is part of a larger study of C88-1044.7 , the results of which will be incorporated into a C88-1044.8 .
This paper summarizes the formalism of C88-1066.1 and describes two C88-1066.2 that interpret it. C88-1066.3 are C88-1066.4 on the cooccurrence of C88-1066.5 in C88-1066.6 which allow the C88-1066.7 which cannot be captured in other current C88-1066.8 . The use of C88-1066.9 leads to C88-1066.10 formulated entirely with C88-1066.11 . The paper shows how conventional algorithms for the analysis of C88-1066.12 can be adapted to the C88-1066.13 . Special attention is given to the part of the C88-1066.14 that checks the fulfillment of C88-1066.15 on C88-1066.16 .
Soames 1979 provides some counterexamples to the C88-2086.1 that is presented in Gazdar 1979. Soames 1982 provides a theory which explains these counterexamples. Mercer 1987 rejects the solution found in Soames 1982 leaving these counterexamples unexplained. By reappraising these insightful counterexamples, the C88-2086.2 described in Mercer 1987, 1988 gives a simple and straightforward explanation for the C88-2086.3 of these C88-2086.4 .
We have developed a C88-2130.1 of the process of describing the layout of an apartment or house, a much-studied C88-2130.2 first characterized linguistically by Linde (1974). The C88-2130.3 is embodied in a program, C88-2130.4 , that can reproduce segments of actual tape-recorded descriptions, using C88-2130.5 derived through analysis of our C88-2130.6 .
C88-2132.1 is C88-2132.2 in the sense that it works from the starting point (usually the beginning of the sentence) extending its activity usually in a rightward manner. We shall introduce the concept of a C88-2132.3 that works outward from C88-2132.4 and makes sense of as much of the C88-2132.5 as it is actually possible, and after that will lead to predictions of missing C88-2132.6 . So, for any place where the easily identifiable C88-2132.7 occur in the C88-2132.8 , the process will extend to both the left and the right of the C88-2132.9 , until possibly completely missing C88-2132.10 are reached. At that point, by virtue of the fact that both a left and a right context were found, C88-2132.11 can be introduced that predict the nature of the missing C88-2132.12 .
A new approach for C88-2160.1 where the C88-2160.2 interacts during the creation or the modification of the C88-2160.3 is proposed. The explanation of an C88-2160.4 or an error for the purposes of correction does not use any concepts of the underlying C88-2160.5 : it is a reformulation of the erroneous or ambiguous C88-2160.6 . The interaction is limited to the analysis step of the C88-2160.7 . This paper presents a new C88-2160.8 based on the C88-2160.9 of a C88-2160.10 's multiple output. Some examples of C88-2160.11 ambiguous C88-2160.12 are presented.
Computer programs so far have not fared well in C88-2162.1 . For one thing, C88-2162.2 applicable in C88-2162.3 does not readily lend itself in the C88-2162.4 . For another, C88-2162.5 used by C88-2162.6 is not geared to C88-2162.7 . We introduced a new C88-2162.8 , the C88-2162.9 [Zernik88], to facilitate C88-2162.10 . From this, a C88-2162.11 was implemented in the program C88-2162.12 , which enhances its own C88-2162.13 by processing examples in context. We identified two tasks: First, how C88-2162.14 are acquired from C88-2162.15 and organized in a C88-2162.16 ; this task was discussed in previous papers [Zernik87]. Second, we show in this paper how a C88-2162.17 is used in predicting new C88-2162.18 . Thus, a C88-2162.19 does not stall even in the presence of a C88-2162.20 , and a C88-2162.21 can be produced for covering that C88-2162.22 .
Although every C88-2166.1 needs a C88-2166.2 , each system puts different amounts and types of information into its C88-2166.3 according to its individual needs. However, some of the information needed across systems is shared or identical information. This paper presents our experience in planning and building C88-2166.4 , a C88-2166.5 designed to be a repository of C88-2166.6 for use by C88-2166.7 . We have drawn primarily on explicit and implicit information from C88-2166.8 to create a C88-2166.9 .
For J88-3002.1 to communicate with J88-3002.2 in a natural manner, they must have knowledge about the J88-3002.3 . This paper explores the role of J88-3002.4 in such J88-3002.5 . It begins with a characterization of what a J88-3002.6 is and how it can be used. The types of information that a J88-3002.7 may be required to keep about a J88-3002.8 are then identified and discussed. J88-3002.9 themselves can vary greatly depending on the requirements of the situation and the implementation, so several dimensions along which they can be classified are presented. Since acquiring the knowledge for a J88-3002.10 is a fundamental problem in J88-3002.11 , a section is devoted to this topic. Next, the benefits and costs of implementing a J88-3002.12 for a system are weighed in light of several aspects of the J88-3002.13 that may be imposed by the system. Finally, the current state of research in J88-3002.14 is summarized, and future research topics that must be addressed in order to achieve powerful, general J88-3002.15 are assessed.
This article introduces a C90-1013.1 called C90-1013.2 , developed for a C90-1013.3 . The system utilizes C90-1013.4 to control the C90-1013.5 in a declarative way. This C90-1013.6 also uses C90-1013.7 to reduce the number of copies of the C90-1013.8 . The C90-1013.9 for this C90-1013.10 is designed to properly generate the C90-1013.11 in a C90-1013.12 .
This paper proposes C90-2032.1 for the disambiguation of the C90-2032.2 of C90-2032.3 . The C90-2032.4 extracts preference knowledge from a C90-2032.5 or other C90-2032.6 automatically. C90-2032.7 can be resolved by using domain targeted preference knowledge without using complicated large C90-2032.8 . C90-2032.9 and C90-2032.10 are described for the the analysis of C90-2032.11 of C90-2032.12 .
This paper describes the framework of a C90-3014.1 using the C90-3014.2 : C90-3014.3 . The approach of C90-3014.4 provides an explicit development model for constructing a computational C90-3014.5 : C90-3014.6 and C90-3014.7 . We show that the proposed approach is more describable than other approaches such as those employing a traditional C90-3014.8 .
The unique properties of C90-3045.1 present a challenge for the application of C90-3045.2 beyond the limited confines of C90-3045.3 , for instance, to the task of C90-3045.4 or C90-3045.5 . We present a variant of C90-3045.6 , called C90-3045.7 , which characterize correspondences between C90-3045.8 . The formalism's intended usage is to relate C90-3045.9 to their associated C90-3045.10 represented in a C90-3045.11 , or to their C90-3045.12 in another C90-3045.13 ; in summary, we intend it to allow C90-3045.14 to be used beyond their role in C90-3045.15 . We discuss the application of C90-3045.16 to concrete examples, mentioning primarily in passing some computational issues that arise in its interpretation.
This paper proposes that C90-3046.1 should be treated as C90-3046.2 , and presents such a treatment for C90-3046.3 using an C90-3046.4 by Konolige, which is a C90-3046.5 of C90-3046.6 , that includes C90-3046.7 and C90-3046.8 that capture C90-3046.9 .
C90-3072.1 have become an integral part of most C90-3072.2 . From different reasons among which the speed of processing prevails they are usually based on C90-3072.3 instead of C90-3072.4 . This approach is sufficient for languages with little C90-3072.5 such as C90-3072.6 , but fails for C90-3072.7 such as C90-3072.8 , C90-3072.9 , C90-3072.10 or other C90-3072.11 . We have developed a special method for describing C90-3072.12 for the purpose of building C90-3072.13 for such languages. The speed of the resulting program lies somewhere in the middle of the scale of existing C90-3072.14 for C90-3072.15 and the main C90-3072.16 fits into the standard C90-3072.17 , whereas the number of recognized C90-3072.18 exceeds 6 million (for C90-3072.19 ). Further, a special method has been developed for easy C90-3072.20 .
We describe the methods and hardware that we are using to produce a real-time demonstration of an H90-1016.1 . We describe algorithms that greatly reduce the computation needed to compute the H90-1016.2 . To avoid H90-1016.3 we use a H90-1016.4 . The H90-1016.5 is implemented on a H90-1016.6 with a single H90-1016.7 , which provides a factor of 5 speed-up over a H90-1016.8 for H90-1016.9 . The H90-1016.10 plugs directly into the H90-1016.11 of the H90-1016.12 , which controls the system and contains the H90-1016.13 and H90-1016.14 .
This paper reports on two contributions to H90-1060.1 . First, we present a new paradigm for H90-1060.2 of H90-1060.3 , which uses a large amount of H90-1060.4 from a few H90-1060.5 instead of the traditional practice of using a little H90-1060.6 from many H90-1060.7 . In addition, combination of the H90-1060.8 is done by averaging the H90-1060.9 of H90-1060.10 rather than the usual pooling of all the H90-1060.11 from many H90-1060.12 prior to H90-1060.13 . With only 12 H90-1060.14 for H90-1060.15 , we achieved a 7.5% H90-1060.16 on a standard H90-1060.17 and H90-1060.18 from the H90-1060.19 . This H90-1060.20 is comparable to our best condition for this test suite, using 109 H90-1060.21 . Second, we show a significant improvement for H90-1060.22 using the new H90-1060.23 and a small amount of H90-1060.24 from the new (target) H90-1060.25 . A H90-1060.26 is estimated independently for each H90-1060.27 and the H90-1060.28 . Each H90-1060.29 is transformed to the H90-1060.30 of the H90-1060.31 and combined by H90-1060.32 . Using only 40 H90-1060.33 from the H90-1060.34 for H90-1060.35 , the H90-1060.36 dropped to 4.1% --- a 45% reduction in error compared to the H90-1060.37 result.
This paper presents a specialized J90-3002.1 for a highly structured J90-3002.2 . The basic goal in building that J90-3002.3 was to provide an adequate tool to help J90-3002.4 produce a valid and coherent J90-3002.5 on the basis of a J90-3002.6 . If we want valuable J90-3002.7 and J90-3002.8 to achieve complex J90-3002.9 , we must provide very powerful tools to help create and ensure the validity of such complex J90-3002.10 . Our most important task in building the J90-3002.11 was to define a set of J90-3002.12 that could be computationally applied to ensure the validity of J90-3002.13 . A customized J90-3002.14 for browsing and editing was also designed and implemented.
The principle known as P90-1014.1 plays an important role in the determination of the P90-1014.2 in the P90-1014.3 . First, by investigating the combinatorics of P90-1014.4 , we show that the problem of enumerating all possible P90-1014.5 requires P90-1014.6 . Secondly, we exhibit a provably optimal P90-1014.7 .
It is often assumed that when A92-1026.1 meets the real world, the ideal of aiming for complete and correct interpretations has to be abandoned. However, our experience with A92-1026.2 ; especially in the A92-1026.3 , has shown that principled techniques for A92-1026.4 can be bolstered with methods for achieving robustness. We describe three techniques for making A92-1026.5 more robust---an A92-1026.6 , a A92-1026.7 , and a new technique called A92-1026.8 . For A92-1026.9 , we describe how the method of A92-1026.10 is inherently robust, in that an interpretation is always possible, so that in the absence of the required A92-1026.11 , performance degrades gracefully. Each of these techniques have been evaluated and the results of the evaluations are presented.
We present an efficient algorithm for A92-1027.1 of A92-1027.2 that is tailored to the problem of extracting specific information from A92-1027.3 where many of the A92-1027.4 are unknown and much of the A92-1027.5 is irrelevant to the task. The A92-1027.6 gains algorithmic efficiency through a A92-1027.7 of its A92-1027.8 . As each new A92-1027.9 is added to the A92-1027.10 , the algorithm checks only the topmost of the A92-1027.11 adjacent to it, rather than all such A92-1027.12 as in conventional treatments. The resulting A92-1027.13 are insured to be the correct ones by carefully controlling the order in which A92-1027.14 are introduced so that every final A92-1027.15 covers the longest possible A92-1027.16 . This is facilitated through the use of A92-1027.17 based on the placement of A92-1027.18 , and by A92-1027.19 that permit certain kinds of A92-1027.20 to be deduced despite the presence of A92-1027.21 . A further A92-1027.22 is achieved by using A92-1027.23 rather than A92-1027.24 on the A92-1027.25 , thereby reducing the amount of A92-1027.26 and thus the number of A92-1027.27 , since only A92-1027.28 with a valid A92-1027.29 interpretation are ever introduced.
In this paper C92-1052.1 are defined and a method for C92-1052.2 primarily based on C92-1052.3 of C92-1052.4 between C92-1052.5 is proposed. This method is precise and C92-1052.6 and is supported by previous work in the area of C92-1052.7 .
In this paper, a discrimination and robustness oriented C92-1055.1 is proposed to deal with the task of C92-1055.2 . Owing to the problem of C92-1055.3 and C92-1055.4 introduced by the C92-1055.5 , traditional C92-1055.6 , which resolve C92-1055.7 by indirectly and implicitly using C92-1055.8 , fail to achieve high C92-1055.9 in real applications. The proposed method remedies these problems by adjusting the parameters to maximize the C92-1055.10 directly. To make the proposed algorithm robust, the possible variations between the C92-1055.11 and the real tasks are also taken into consideration by enlarging the C92-1055.12 between the correct candidate and its competing members. Significant improvement has been observed in the test. The C92-1055.13 of C92-1055.14 is raised from 46.0% to 60.62% by using this novel approach.
C92-2068.1 remains the most expensive part of C92-2068.2 . We focus on one speed-up element in the design of C92-2068.3 : avoidance of C92-2068.4 of C92-2068.5 . We propose a method of attaining such a design through a method of C92-2068.6 which avoids C92-2068.7 often associated with C92-2068.8 without any use of costly C92-2068.9 . The proposed scheme eliminates C92-2068.10 while maintaining the C92-2068.11 to avoid C92-2068.12 and C92-2068.13 combined with its ability to handle C92-2068.14 without algorithmic additions.
The C92-2115.1 in C92-2115.2 has been considered to be more complicated than C92-2115.3 and C92-2115.4 , since it is inherently a conglomeration of individual C92-2115.5 . Currently some attempts are being made to use C92-2115.6 in C92-2115.7 , that is, to make decisions on the basis of C92-2115.8 at appropriate pints in C92-2115.9 . This paper proposes a new type of C92-2115.10 , called a C92-2115.11 , for use in such C92-2115.12 .
This paper introduces a robust C92-3165.1 . The C92-3165.2 is enhanced in this approach. C92-3165.3 proceeds from left to right correcting minor errors. When a very noisy C92-3165.4 is detected, the C92-3165.5 skips that C92-3165.6 using a fake C92-3165.7 . The unidentified C92-3165.8 is resolved by C92-3165.9 of that C92-3165.10 which is parsed very efficiently by using the C92-3165.11 of the first C92-3165.12 . The C92-3165.13 does not have to speak the whole C92-3165.14 again. This method is also capable of handling C92-3165.15 , which is important in practical systems. Detected C92-3165.16 can be incrementally incorporated into the C92-3165.17 after the interaction with the C92-3165.18 . A C92-3165.19 has shown great effectiveness of this approach.
C92-4199.1 has been an important and active issue in C92-4199.2 . In this paper, a new mechanism, based on the concept of C92-4199.3 , is proposed for identifying C92-4199.4 , especially C92-4199.5 , in C92-4199.6 . The proposed mechanism includes C92-4199.7 , C92-4199.8 , C92-4199.9 . We will show the experimental results for two C92-4199.10 and compare them with the results by the C92-4199.11 , the only system that we know has attacked the same problem. The experimental results have shown significant improvements over the C92-4199.12 without the C92-4199.13 capability.
This paper describes the understanding process of the C92-4207.1 in C92-4207.2 . In order to understand the described C92-4207.3 , the authors try to reconstruct the geometric model of the global scene from the scenic descriptions drawing a space. It is done by an experimental C92-4207.4  C92-4207.5 , which takes C92-4207.6 and produces a C92-4207.7 of the described C92-4207.8 . To reconstruct the C92-4207.9 , the authors extract the C92-4207.10 from the C92-4207.11 , and represent them as the C92-4207.12 on the C92-4207.13 of the C92-4207.14 . This makes it possible to express the vagueness of the C92-4207.15 and to derive the maximally plausible interpretation from a chunk of information accumulated as the constraints. The interpretation reflects the C92-4207.16 about the C92-4207.17 .
This paper describes a recently collected H92-1003.1 for the H92-1003.2 . This data collection effort has been co-ordinated by H92-1003.3 . We summarize the motivation for this effort, the goals, the implementation of a H92-1003.4 , and the accomplishments of H92-1003.5 in monitoring the H92-1003.6 and distribution of 12,000 H92-1003.7 of H92-1003.8 from five sites for use in a H92-1003.9 .
The paper provides an overview of the research conducted at H92-1010.1 in the field of H92-1010.2 , but also in the related areas of H92-1010.3 , including H92-1010.4 , H92-1010.5 . Also presented are the commercial applications of some of the research projects. When applicable, the discussion is placed in the framework of international collaborations.
This paper describes the status of the H92-1016.1 as of February 1992, focusing especially on the changes made to the H92-1016.2 . These include H92-1016.3 , the use of a H92-1016.4 in conjunction with a H92-1016.5 , and refinements made to the H92-1016.6 . Together with the use of a larger H92-1016.7 , these modifications combined to reduce the H92-1016.8 by a factor of 2.5 and 1.6, respectively, on the H92-1016.9 . The weighted error for the entire H92-1016.10 on the same H92-1016.11 is 49.3%. Similar results were also obtained on the H92-1016.12 .
This paper describes three relatively H92-1017.1 recently added to the H92-1017.2 : H92-1017.3 , H92-1017.4 , and H92-1017.5 . In addition, we discuss the results of the H92-1017.6 . We describe a variation on the H92-1017.7 which provides a more tightly controlled measure of progress. Finally, we briefly describe an experiment which we have done in extending the H92-1017.8 to improving H92-1017.9  H92-1017.10 .
We describe a H92-1026.1 , which we call H92-1026.2 , that takes advantage of detailed H92-1026.3 to resolve H92-1026.4 . H92-1026.5 incorporates H92-1026.6 from the H92-1026.7 into the H92-1026.8 in a novel way. We use a H92-1026.9 , called a H92-1026.10 , in combination with H92-1026.11 to tease out the relevant aspects of a H92-1026.12 that will determine the correct H92-1026.13 of a H92-1026.14 . This stands in contrast to the usual approach of further H92-1026.15 tailoring via the usual H92-1026.16 in the hope of generating the correct H92-1026.17 . In H92-1026.18 against one of the best existing robust H92-1026.19 , which we call H92-1026.20 , the H92-1026.21 significantly outperforms H92-1026.22 , increasing the H92-1026.23 rate from 60% to 75%, a 37% reduction in error.
We discuss H92-1036.1 of H92-1036.2 . The classical H92-1036.3 , namely the H92-1036.4 and the H92-1036.5 , are expanded and H92-1036.6 are given for H92-1036.7 . Because of its adaptive nature, H92-1036.8 serves as a unified approach for the following four H92-1036.9 applications, namely H92-1036.10 , H92-1036.11 , H92-1036.12 and H92-1036.13 . New experimental results on all four applications are provided to show the effectiveness of the H92-1036.14 .
It is well-known that there are H92-1045.1 like H92-1045.2 whose H92-1045.3 or H92-1045.4 depends on the context of use. We have recently reported on two new H92-1045.5 , one trained on H92-1045.6 (the H92-1045.7 ) and the other trained on H92-1045.8 ( H92-1045.9 and H92-1045.10 ). As this work was nearing completion, we observed a very strong H92-1045.11 effect. That is, if a H92-1045.12 such as H92-1045.13 appears two or more times in a H92-1045.14 , it is extremely likely that they will all share the same H92-1045.15 . This paper describes an experiment which confirmed this hypothesis and found that the tendency to share H92-1045.16 in the same H92-1045.17 is extremely strong (98%). This result can be used as an additional source of H92-1045.18 for improving the performance of the H92-1045.19 . In addition, it could also be used to help evaluate H92-1045.20 that did not make use of the H92-1045.21 .
In this paper, we explore correlation of P06-1112.1 to rank candidate answers in P06-1112.2 . Using the P06-1112.3 , we compare P06-1112.4 of a candidate answer and mapped P06-1112.5 in P06-1112.6 with the corresponding P06-1112.7 in question. Different from previous studies, we propose an P06-1112.8 and incorporate the P06-1112.9 into the P06-1112.10 . The correlations are further incorporated into a P06-1112.11 which estimates P06-1112.12 from training. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art P06-1112.13 by up to 20% in P06-1112.14 .
C90-3063.1 of C90-3063.2 in broad domains is very expensive. This paper presents an automatic scheme for collecting statistics on C90-3063.3 in a large C90-3063.4 . To a large extent, these statistics reflect C90-3063.5 and thus are used to disambiguate C90-3063.6 and C90-3063.7 . The scheme was implemented by gathering statistics on the output of other linguistic tools. An experiment was performed to resolve C90-3063.8 of the C90-3063.9 in C90-3063.10 that were randomly selected from the C90-3063.11 . The results of the experiment show that in most of the cases the C90-3063.12 indeed reflect the C90-3063.13 and thus provide a basis for a useful C90-3063.14 .
We consider the problem of computing the C04-1011.1 , also called the C04-1011.2 , between a C04-1011.3 and a C04-1011.4 . We show that there is a C04-1011.5 for one part of the C04-1011.6 , viz. the C04-1011.7 . We discuss several applications of the result to the problem of C04-1011.8 of C04-1011.9 by means of C04-1011.10 .
Methods developed for A94-1037.1 for A94-1037.2 like A94-1037.3 (see the review by Kukich (Kukich, 1992)) are not readily applicable to A94-1037.4 . This poster presents an approach to A94-1037.5 in A94-1037.6 that is based on A94-1037.7 and a A94-1037.8 . After an overview of our approach, we present results from experiments with A94-1037.9 in A94-1037.10 .
The major objective of this program is to develop and demonstrate robust, high performance H94-1102.1 focussed on application in H94-1102.2 which will enhance the effectiveness of H94-1102.3 . A key complementary objective is to define and develop applications of robust H94-1102.4 , and to help catalyze the transition of H94-1102.5 into H94-1102.6 , with particular focus on application of robust H94-1102.7 to H94-1102.8 . The research effort focusses on developing advanced H94-1102.9 , rapid search, and H94-1102.10 for robust H94-1102.11 , and on applying these techniques to the new H94-1102.12 and to military application tasks.
In this paper, we present a framework, P98-1118.1 , for the development and customization of P98-1118.2 . P98-1118.3 offers intuitive and powerful P98-1118.4 specifying the presentation at different levels: macro-planning, micro-planning, realization, and formatting. P98-1118.5 is implemented and is portable cross-platform and cross-domain. It has been used with success in several application domains including weather forecasting, P98-1118.6 , system description and P98-1118.7 .
A meaningful evaluation methodology can advance the state-of-the-art by encouraging mature, practical applications rather than "toy" implementations. Evaluation is also crucial to assessing competing claims and identifying promising technical approaches. While work in A92-1023.1 has a history of evaluation methodologies that permit comparison among various systems, until recently no methodology existed for either developers of A92-1023.2 or researchers in A92-1023.3 to evaluate and compare the systems they developed. Recently considerable progress has been made by a number of groups involved in the A92-1023.4 to agree on a methodology for comparative evaluation of A92-1023.5 , and that methodology has been put into practice several times in comparative tests of several A92-1023.6 . These evaluations are probably the only A92-1023.7 other than the series of A92-1023.8 (Sundheim, 1989; Sundheim, 1991) to have been developed and used by a group of researchers at different sites, although several excellent workshops have been held to study some of these problems (Palmer et al., 1989; Neal et al., 1991). This paper describes a practical A92-1023.9 for automatic evaluation of A92-1023.10 . While each new application domain will require some development of special resources, the heart of the methodology is domain-independent, and it can be used with either A92-1023.11 . The particular characteristics of the approach are described in the following section: subsequent sections present its implementation in the A92-1023.12 , and some problems and directions for future development.
The P06-1053.1 provides evidence for P06-1053.2 , i.e., the tendency to repeat structures. This paper describes a method for incorporating P06-1053.3 into an P06-1053.4 . Three models are compared, which involve P06-1053.5 of P06-1053.6 between P06-1053.7 , within P06-1053.8 , and within P06-1053.9 . These models simulate the reading time advantage for P06-1053.10 found in P06-1053.11 , and also yield a small increase in overall P06-1053.12 .
Instances of a P06-1012.1 drawn from different P06-1012.2 may have different P06-1012.3 (the proportions of the different P06-1012.4 of a P06-1012.5 ). This in turn affects the accuracy of P06-1012.6 trained and applied on different P06-1012.7 . This paper presents a method to estimate the P06-1012.8 of P06-1012.9 drawn from a new P06-1012.10 , and highlights the importance of using P06-1012.11 when performing these P06-1012.12 . By using P06-1012.13 , we are able to estimate the P06-1012.14 effectively to achieve significant improvements in P06-1012.15 .
How to obtain C86-1105.1 (e.g. C86-1105.2 , C86-1105.3 ) is one of the most important problems for C86-1105.4 . A pilot system for extracting these C86-1105.5 automatically from an ordinary C86-1105.6 (Shinmeikai Kokugojiten, published by Sansei-do, in machine readable form) is given. The features of the C86-1105.7 in the C86-1105.8 , the mechanical extraction of the C86-1105.9 and the estimation of the results are discussed.
The C86-1021.1 has been repeatedly advocated by researchers originally interested in C86-1021.2 who take C86-1021.3 to be one possible application. However, not only the C86-1021.4 but also the vagueness which every C86-1021.5 inevitably has leads this approach into essential difficulties. In contrast, our project, the C86-1021.6 , adopts the C86-1021.7 as the basic framework of C86-1021.8 . This paper describes the detailed construction of the C86-1021.9 of our system from C86-1021.10 to C86-1021.11 , and gives some examples of problems which seem difficult to treat in the C86-1021.12 . The basic design principles of the C86-1021.13 of our system have already been mentioned in (1) (2). Some of the principles which are relevant to the topic of this paper are: (a) C86-1021.14 (b) C86-1021.15 (c) C86-1021.16 (d) C86-1021.17 . This paper also shows how these principles are realized in the current system.
Empirical experience and observations have shown us when powerful and highly tunable C04-1058.1 such as C04-1058.2 , C04-1058.3 and C04-1058.4 are applied to C04-1058.5 , it is possible to achieve high accuracies, but eventually their performances all tend to plateau out at around the same point. To further improve performance, various C04-1058.6 have been developed, but in practice, most of them cannot be relied on to predictably improve performance on C04-1058.7 ; indeed, depending upon the C04-1058.8 , they are as likely to degrade accuracy as to improve it. This problem is especially severe if the C04-1058.9 has already been finely tuned. In recent work, we introduced C04-1058.10 , an intriguing C04-1058.11 that is designed to work in these extreme operating conditions. Despite its simplicity, it consistently and robustly improves the accuracy of existing highly accurate C04-1058.12 . This paper investigates some of the more surprising claims made by C04-1058.13 , and presents experiments supporting an C04-1058.14 that more complex models are damaging or unnecessary in practice.
The study addresses the problem of N06-1007.1 of N06-1007.2 between N06-1007.3 . While this task has much in common with N06-1007.4 which aims to discover N06-1007.5 between N06-1007.6 , the main challenge of N06-1007.7 is to capture N06-1007.8 . Motivated by the intuition that it often underlies the N06-1007.9 of N06-1007.10 , we develop a method that discovers N06-1007.11 using evidence about N06-1007.12 between N06-1007.13 available in a N06-1007.14 . In comparison with earlier work, the proposed method covers a much wider range of N06-1007.15 and learns the N06-1007.16 between N06-1007.17 with highly varied N06-1007.18 .
This paper presents a new approach to A00-2023.1 in which alternative A00-2023.2 are represented as packed sets of A00-2023.3 , or A00-2023.4 , and then ranked statistically to choose the best one. This representation offers advantages in compactness and in the ability to represent A00-2023.5 . It also facilitates more efficient A00-2023.6 than a previous approach to A00-2023.7 . An efficient A00-2023.8 is described, together with experimental results showing significant improvements over simple enumeration or a A00-2023.9 .
X98-1022.1 and X98-1022.2 are two important Internet services. X98-1022.3 and X98-1022.4 play their appropriate roles in the next generation Internet. This paper focuses on the X98-1022.5 and proposes two different models to extract X98-1022.6 for X98-1022.7 under two tasks initiated by X98-1022.8 . For X98-1022.9 , X98-1022.10 and X98-1022.11 are used cooperatively to construct generic, indicative X98-1022.12 . For adhoc task, a X98-1022.13 based on relationship between X98-1022.14 and X98-1022.15 is used to filter out irrelevant X98-1022.16 , to rank relevant X98-1022.17 , and to generate the X98-1022.18 . The result shows that the X98-1022.19 of the best summary and that of the fixed summary for adhoc tasks are 0.456 and 0. 447. The X98-1022.20 of the best summary and that of the fixed summary for X98-1022.21 are 0.4090 and 0.4023. Our system outperforms the average system in X98-1022.22 but does a common job in adhoc task.
This paper describes methods for relating (threading) multiple newspaper articles, and for visualizing various characteristics of them by using a P98-2213.1 . A set of articles is represented by a set of P98-2213.2 , and the P98-2213.3 between the P98-2213.4 is then calculated. The P98-2213.5 is constructed from the P98-2213.6 . By applying some P98-2213.7 on the chronological ordering of articles, an efficient P98-2213.8 that runs in P98-2213.9 (where n is the number of articles) is obtained. The constructed P98-2213.10 is visualized with P98-2213.11 that represent the P98-2213.12 of the P98-2213.13 , and P98-2213.14 that represent new P98-2213.15 in each article. The P98-2213.16 is suitable for Webcasting (push) applications. A P98-2213.17 determines relationships among articles from various news sources, and creates files containing their P98-2213.18 . This information is represented in P98-2213.19 , and can be visualized on most Web browsers. The P98-2213.20 and a current prototype are described in this paper.
In this paper we sketch an approach for P98-1113.1 . Our approach is an P98-1113.2 , which relies mainly on examples that already parsed to their P98-1113.3 , and on the knowledge that we can get from these examples the required information to parse a new P98-1113.4 . In our approach, examples are annotated with the P98-1113.5 where each P98-1113.6 describes a P98-1113.7 , a P98-1113.8 as well as the correspondence between P98-1113.9 in the P98-1113.10 and P98-1113.11 in the P98-1113.12 . In the process of P98-1113.13 , we first try to build P98-1113.14 for P98-1113.15 in the P98-1113.16 which have been successfully found in the P98-1113.17 - a bottom up approach. These P98-1113.18 will then be combined together to form a P98-1113.19 based on an example with similar P98-1113.20 - a top down approach.Keywords:
This paper proposes a P02-1060.1 and an P02-1060.2 , from which a P02-1060.3 is built to recognize and classify P02-1060.4 , P02-1060.5 . Through the P02-1060.6 , our system is able to apply and integrate four types of internal and external evidences : 1) simple deterministic internal feature of the P02-1060.7 , such as P02-1060.8 and digitalization ; 2) P02-1060.9 of important triggers ; 3) P02-1060.10 ; 4) P02-1060.11 . In this way, the P02-1060.12 can be resolved effectively. Evaluation of our P02-1060.13 on P02-1060.14 achieves P02-1060.15 of 96.6% and 94.1% respectively. It shows that the performance is significantly better than reported by any other P02-1060.16 . Moreover, the P02-1060.17 is even consistently better than those based on P02-1060.18 .
Porting a C96-2213.1 to a C96-2213.2 remains one of the bottlenecks in C96-2213.3 , because of the amount of effort required to fix gaps in the C96-2213.4 , and to attune the C96-2213.5 to the idiosyncracies of the C96-2213.6 . This paper shows how the process of fitting a C96-2213.7 to a C96-2213.8 can be automated to a great extent by using a C96-2213.9 that combines C96-2213.10 with a C96-2213.11 .
We propose a C04-1102.1 for orthographic variants caused by C04-1102.2 in a large C04-1102.3 . The method employs two C04-1102.4 . One is C04-1102.5 based on C04-1102.6 . The other is C04-1102.7 by a C04-1102.8 . Experimental results show that the method performed a 0.889 C04-1102.9 in an open test.
Recent years have seen increasing research on extracting and using temporal information in N06-1018.1 . However most of the works found in the literature have focused on identifying and understanding N06-1018.2 in N06-1018.3 . In this paper we report our work on anchoring N06-1018.4 in a novel N06-1018.5 , emails. The highly under-specified nature of these N06-1018.6 fits well with our N06-1018.7 of time, N06-1018.8 . We have developed and evaluated a N06-1018.9 , and the result shows that it performs significantly better than the N06-1018.10 , and compares favorably with some of the closely related work.
The goal of this research is to develop a H89-2066.1 that will demonstrate the usefulness of H89-2066.2 for H89-2066.3 . The system will accept H89-2066.4 , and will handle H89-2066.5 without H89-2066.6 . Combining H89-2066.7 and H89-2066.8 to achieve H89-2066.9 , the system will be demonstrated in an H89-2066.10 relevant to the DoD. The objective of this project is to develop a H89-2066.11 using a H89-2066.12 to H89-2066.13 . The H89-2066.14 will eventually be integrated with H89-2066.15 to achieve H89-2066.16 .
This paper reports recent research into methods for J81-1002.1 . A new J81-1002.2 called J81-1002.3 has been created and an experimental system implemented in it. The J81-1002.4 to be expressed in J81-1002.5 is first divided into small J81-1002.6 , which are then composed into appropriate combinations and converted into J81-1002.7 . J81-1002.8 , which embodies this paradigm, has distinct parts devoted to creation of the J81-1002.9 , to organization of the J81-1002.10 , to prevention of J81-1002.11 , to creation of combinations of units, to evaluation of these combinations as potential J81-1002.12 , to selection of the best among competing combinations, and to creation of the J81-1002.13 . The J81-1002.14 and the J81-1002.15 of J81-1002.16 are described.
C90-1002.1 is under development which represents a departure from C90-1002.2 in that it combines both C90-1002.3 . The connectionist component is trained either from C90-1002.4 derived from the C90-1002.5 of a C90-1002.6 . The development and evolution of such a C90-1002.7 has lead to a C90-1002.8 which is superior to any C90-1002.9 . Experiments are described and powerful C90-1002.10 are demonstrated that permit C90-1002.11 by the C90-1002.12 in the C90-1002.13 . This approach has permitted some simplifications to the C90-1002.14 of other C90-1002.15 , including the elimination of C90-1002.16 and priorities. Furthermore, C90-1002.17 is performed more robustly and with more tolerance for error. Data are presented which show how a C90-1002.18 trained with C90-1002.19 can parse both C90-1002.20 as well as some novel (ungrammatical or lexically ambiguous) sentences.
The paper proposes and empirically motivates an integration of P02-1059.1 with P02-1059.2 to deal with human biases in P02-1059.3 . In particular, we explore the use of P02-1059.4 within the clustering framework to account for the variation as well as regularity in P02-1059.5 . The P02-1059.6 of human created extracts is created from a P02-1059.7 and used as a test set. We build P02-1059.8 of different flavors and integrate each of them with the clustering framework. Experiments with the P02-1059.9 demonstrate that the mixture of the two paradigms generally gives a significant boost in performance compared to cases where either ofthe two is considered alone.
We describe a speedup for training P02-1002.1 . The algorithm is a simple variation on P02-1002.2 , but converges roughly an order of magnitude faster, depending on the number of constraints, and the way speed is measured. Rather than attempting to train all model parameters simultaneously, the algorithm trains them sequentially. The algorithm is easy to implement, typically uses only slightly more memory, and will lead to improvements for most P02-1002.3 .
In this paper, we describe a search procedure for C00-2123.1 based on C00-2123.2 . Starting from a DP-based solution to the traveling salesman problem, we present a novel technique to restrict the possible C00-2123.3 between C00-2123.4 in order to achieve an efficient search algorithm. A search restriction especially useful for the translation direction from German to English is presented. The experimental tests are carried out on the C00-2123.5 (German-English, 8000-word vocabulary), which is a C00-2123.6 .
This paper addresses the issue of C96-1055.1 in extraction from C96-1055.2 for the construction of C96-1055.3 . We describe two experiments: one which ignored C96-1055.4 , resulting in 6.3% accuracy for C96-1055.5 of C96-1055.6 based on (Levin, 1993); and one which exploited C96-1055.7 , resulting in 97.9% accuracy. These experiments were dual purpose: (1) to validate the central thesis of the work of (Levin, 1993), i.e., that C96-1055.8 and C96-1055.9 are predictably related; (2) to demonstrate that a 15-fold improvement can be achieved in deriving C96-1055.10 from C96-1055.11 if we first divide the C96-1055.12 into distinct groupings that correlate with different C96-1055.13 . Finally, we show that we can provide effective acquisition techniques for novel C96-1055.14 using a combination of online sources.
The M91-1029.1 has been under development as an Independent Research and Development project at PRC since 1984. The objective is a generic system of tools, including a M91-1029.2 , M91-1029.3 , and concept representations, for building M91-1029.4 for M91-1029.5 . Systems built with M91-1029.6 are intended to generate input to knowledge based systems ordata base systems. Input to the M91-1029.7 is typically derived from an existing M91-1029.8 , such as a news wire. M91-1029.9 supports the adaptation of the generic core to a variety of domains: M91-1029.10 , M91-1029.11 , M91-1029.12 about a specific type of event, such as financial transfers or terrorist acts, etc., by acquiring M91-1029.13 , M91-1029.14 , and M91-1029.15 . The long-term goal is a system that can support the processing of relatively long discourses in domains that are fairly broad with a high rate of success.
The multiplicative fragment of P98-1088.1 has found a number of applications in P98-1088.2 : in the P98-1088.3 approach to P98-1088.4 , and in the formulation and P98-1088.5 of various P98-1088.6 . These applications call for efficient deduction methods. Although a number of deduction methods for P98-1088.7 are known, none of them are tabular methods, which bring a substantial efficiency gain by avoiding redundant computation (cf. chart methods in P98-1088.8 ): this paper presents such a method, and discusses its use in relation to the above applications.
We describe an implementation of data-driven selection of emphatic facial displays for an E06-1045.1 in a E06-1045.2 . A E06-1045.3 in the domain of the E06-1045.4 was recorded, and the facial displays used by the E06-1045.5 were annotated. The data from those recordings was used in a range of models for generating facial displays, each model making use of a different amount of E06-1045.6 or choosing displays differently within a E06-1045.7 . The models were evaluated in two ways: by E06-1045.8 against the E06-1045.9 , and by asking users to rate the output. The predictions of the E06-1045.10 study differed from the actual user ratings. While the E06-1045.11 gave the highest scores to models making a majority choice within a context, the user study showed a significant preference for models that produced more variation. This preference was especially strong among the female subjects.
We present the first application of the P04-1030.1 of Collins (1999) as a P04-1030.2 and P04-1030.3 for P04-1030.4 . The model is adapted to an P04-1030.5 for P04-1030.6 , integrating acoustic, n-gram, and parser probabilities. The P04-1030.7 uses P04-1030.8 not considered by P04-1030.9 , conditioning recognition on more linguistically-grounded relationships. Experiments on the P04-1030.10 and lattice corpora show P04-1030.11 competitive with the P04-1030.12 while extracting additional P04-1030.13 useful for P04-1030.14 .
Reducing P02-1023.1 is a critical issue when applying a P02-1023.2 to realistic applications which have memory constraints. In this paper, three measures are studied for the purpose of P02-1023.3 . They are probability, P02-1023.4 , and P02-1023.5 . We evaluated the performance of the three P02-1023.6 in a real application of P02-1023.7 in terms of P02-1023.8 . We first present an empirical comparison, showing that P02-1023.9 performs the best in most cases. We also show that the high-performance of P02-1023.10 lies in its strong correlation with P02-1023.11 . We then present a novel method of combining two criteria in P02-1023.12 . Experimental results show that the combined criterion consistently leads to smaller models than the models pruned using either of the criteria separately, at the same P02-1023.13 .
Multimodal interfaces require effective C00-1054.1 and understanding of C00-1054.2 whose content is distributed across multiple input modes. Johnston 1998 presents an approach in which strategies for C00-1054.3 are stated declaratively using a C00-1054.4 that is used by a C00-1054.5 to compose inputs. This approach is highly expressive and supports a broad class of C00-1054.6 , but offers only limited potential for mutual compensation among the input modes, is subject to significant concerns in terms of computational complexity, and complicates selection among alternative multimodal interpretations of the input. In this paper, we present an alternative approach in which C00-1054.7 are achieved using a C00-1054.8 which takes C00-1054.9 as inputs and outputs their joint interpretation. This approach is significantly more efficient, enables tight-coupling of multimodal understanding with C00-1054.10 , and provides a general probabilistic framework for C00-1054.11 .
This paper proposes to use a N06-1037.1 over N06-1037.2 to model N06-1037.3 for N06-1037.4 . Our study reveals that the N06-1037.5 embedded in a N06-1037.6 are very effective for N06-1037.7 and these features can be well captured by the N06-1037.8 . Evaluation on the N06-1037.9 shows that the N06-1037.10 over N06-1037.11 can achieve comparable performance with the previous best-reported feature-based methods on the 24 N06-1037.12 . It also shows that our method significantly outperforms the previous two N06-1037.13 on the 5 N06-1037.14 .
This paper describes a particular approach to H90-1011.1 that utilizes recent advances in H90-1011.2 and in H90-1011.3 . As H90-1011.4 are extended to handle richer descriptions of H90-1011.5 , they begin to share many of the properties that have been developed in H90-1011.6 . This commonality suggests that some of the H90-1011.7 can be applied to H90-1011.8 . This merging supports the integration of H90-1011.9 into the same system, simultaneously subject to the same types of processes, in an efficient manner. The result is expected to be more H90-1011.10 due to the increased organization of knowledge. The use of a H90-1011.11 for H90-1011.12 and H90-1011.13 was first explored in the H90-1011.14 [2], in which H90-1011.15 is characterized as an inference process called H90-1011.16 .
"To explain complex phenomena, an J97-1004.1 must be able to select information from a formal representation of J97-1004.2 , organize the selected information into J97-1004.3 , and realize the J97-1004.4 in text. Although recent years have witnessed significant progress in the development of sophisticated computational mechanisms for J97-1004.5 , empirical results have been limited. This paper reports on a seven-year effort to empirically study J97-1004.6 from J97-1004.7 . In particular, it describes a J97-1004.8 that constructs J97-1004.9 from the a J97-1004.10 in the domain of botanical anatomy, physiology, and development. We introduce the evaluation methodology and describe how performance was assessed with this methodology in the most extensive empirical evaluation conducted on an explanation system. In this evaluation, scored within ""half a grade"" of domain experts, and its performance exceeded that of one of the domain experts."
We present a novel approach for automatically acquiring P04-2005.1 . Given a particular P04-2005.2 , or P04-2005.3 , a P04-2005.4 is a set of P04-2005.5 that tend to co-occur with it. P04-2005.6 can be useful in a number of P04-2005.7 , such as P04-2005.8 and P04-2005.9 . Our method takes advantage of the different way in which P04-2005.10 are lexicalised in P04-2005.11 and P04-2005.12 , and also exploits the large amount of P04-2005.13 available in P04-2005.14 and on the Web. We evaluated the P04-2005.15 on a P04-2005.16 , where we trained a P04-2005.17 on P04-2005.18 , with promising results.
This paper presents a novel P04-2010.1 to resolving P04-2010.2 . P04-2010.3 , the method in question, combines the moderately accurate P04-2010.4 of several P04-2010.5 to form a highly accurate one. Experiments show that this approach is superior to a single P04-2010.6 . Furthermore, we present a P04-2010.7 that resolves P04-2010.8 in P04-2010.9 by using a fully automatic sequence of P04-2010.10 that mimics the P04-2010.11 . Although the system performs well within a limited P04-2010.12 , further research is needed to make it effective for P04-2010.13 and P04-2010.14 .
This paper presents a C04-1035.1 to C04-1035.2 in C04-1035.3 . We extract a set of C04-1035.4 from a C04-1035.5 and formulate them as C04-1035.6 . We then use the predicates of such C04-1035.7 to create a set of C04-1035.8 to annotate an C04-1035.9 , and run two different C04-1035.10 : SLIPPER, a C04-1035.11 , and TiMBL, a C04-1035.12 . Both learners perform well, yielding similar C04-1035.13 of approx 90%. The results show that the C04-1035.14 in terms of which we formulate our C04-1035.15 have significant predictive power, and that C04-1035.16 that closely resemble our C04-1035.17 can be learnt automatically from these C04-1035.18 .
We suggest a new goal and C04-1036.1 for C04-1036.2 . The new criterion &#8211; C04-1036.3 &#8211; fits the needs of C04-1036.4 and can be evaluated directly (independent of an application) at a good level of C04-1036.5 . Motivated by this C04-1036.6 we analyze the empirical quality of C04-1036.7 and its impact on C04-1036.8 , proposing an objective measure for evaluating C04-1036.9 . Finally, a novel C04-1036.10 is presented, which yields superior C04-1036.11 and better C04-1036.12 .
The work presented in this paper is the first step in a project which aims to cluster and summarise C04-1068.1 in the context of C04-1068.2 . The eventual objective of this project is to use these C04-1068.3 to assist help-desk users and operators. In this paper, we identify C04-1068.4 of C04-1068.5 that influence the C04-1068.6 , and offer a C04-1068.7 that removes undesirable C04-1068.8 . We tested the C04-1068.9 on C04-1068.10 , and evaluated their C04-1068.11 by means of two experiments : C04-1068.12 simple C04-1068.13 .
We present a new HMM tagger that exploits C04-1080.1 on both sides of a C04-1080.2 to be tagged, and evaluate it in both the C04-1080.3 . Along the way, we present the first comprehensive comparison of C04-1080.4 , noting that published results to date have not been comparable across C04-1080.5 or C04-1080.6 . Observing that the C04-1080.7 of the C04-1080.8 greatly impacts the C04-1080.9 that can be achieved by the C04-1080.10 , we present a method of C04-1080.11 that improves C04-1080.12 when C04-1080.13 of C04-1080.14 is unstable. Finally, we show how this new tagger achieves state-of-the-art results in a C04-1080.15 .
Past work of generating C04-1096.1 mainly utilized attributes of C04-1096.2 and C04-1096.3 between C04-1096.4 . However, such an approach does not work well when there is no distinctive attribute among C04-1096.5 . To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a method utilizing the perceptual groups of C04-1096.6 and C04-1096.7 among them. The key is to identify groups of C04-1096.8 that are naturally recognized by humans. We conducted psychological experiments with 42 subjects to collect C04-1096.9 in such situations, and built a C04-1096.10 based on the results. The evaluation using another 23 subjects showed that the proposed method could effectively generate proper referring expressions.
C04-1103.1 plays an important role in many C04-1103.2 . In this paper, a novel framework for C04-1103.3 that allows us to carry out C04-1103.4 between two different C04-1103.5 is presented. Under this framework, a C04-1103.6 , also called C04-1103.7 , is further proposed to model the C04-1103.8 . We evaluate the proposed methods through several C04-1103.9 for C04-1103.10 . Our study reveals that the proposed method not only reduces an extensive C04-1103.11 but also improves the C04-1103.12 significantly.
In this paper, we present a C04-1112.1 for C04-1112.2 which combines C04-1112.3 ( C04-1112.4 ) with C04-1112.5 . Instead of building individual C04-1112.6 per C04-1112.7 , we introduce a C04-1112.8 . The advantage of this novel method is that it clusters all C04-1112.9 of an C04-1112.10 in one C04-1112.11 , therefore augmenting the C04-1112.12 available to the C04-1112.13 . Testing the C04-1112.14 on the C04-1112.15 , we achieve a significant increase in C04-1112.16 over the C04-1112.17 . Also, the C04-1112.18 is smaller and more robust.
We present a C04-1116.1 for finding C04-1116.2 based on the C04-1116.3 in a set of coherent C04-1116.4 . This paper proposes a new methodology to improve the C04-1116.5 of a C04-1116.6 using each author's C04-1116.7 as a coherent C04-1116.8 . Our approach is based on the idea that one person tends to use one C04-1116.9 for one C04-1116.10 . According to our assumption, most of the C04-1116.11 with C04-1116.12 in each author's C04-1116.13 tend not to be C04-1116.14 . Our proposed method improves the C04-1116.15 of our C04-1116.16 , showing that our approach is successful.
While C04-1128.1 as an approach to C04-1128.2 has been shown to work in C04-1128.3 of certain C04-1128.4 , because of the conversational nature of C04-1128.5 where C04-1128.6 are made in relation to one made previously, C04-1128.7 may not capture the necessary C04-1128.8 of C04-1128.9 that would make a C04-1128.10 coherent. In this paper, we present our work on the detection of C04-1128.11 in an C04-1128.12 for the task of C04-1128.13 . We show that various C04-1128.14 based on the structure of email-threads can be used to improve upon C04-1128.15 of C04-1128.16 for C04-1128.17 .
We present a framework for the fast C04-1147.1 of C04-1147.2 . The framework is composed of a novel algorithm to efficiently compute the C04-1147.3 between pairs of C04-1147.4 , an C04-1147.5 , and a C04-1147.6 . In comparison with previous C04-1147.7 , which either use arbitrary windows to compute C04-1147.8 between C04-1147.9 or use C04-1147.10 to create C04-1147.11 , in this paper we focus on C04-1147.12 intended to capture the C04-1147.13 of any pair of C04-1147.14 or C04-1147.15 at any distance in the C04-1147.16 . The framework is flexible, allowing fast C04-1147.17 to C04-1147.18 and it is scalable. We apply it in combination with a C04-1147.19 to answer C04-1147.20 , achieving encouraging results.
The paper presents a method for C04-1192.1 based on C04-1192.2 . The method exploits recent advances in C04-1192.3 and C04-1192.4 based on C04-1192.5 of C04-1192.6 and being supported by available aligned C04-1192.7 for the C04-1192.8 in the C04-1192.9 . The C04-1192.10 are aligned to the C04-1192.11 , according to the principles established by C04-1192.12 . The evaluation of the C04-1192.13 , implementing the method described herein showed very encouraging results. The same system used in a validation mode, can be used to check and spot C04-1192.14 in C04-1192.15 as C04-1192.16 and C04-1192.17 .
We present N04-1022.1 for N04-1022.2 . This statistical approach aims to minimize N04-1022.3 of N04-1022.4 under N04-1022.5 that measure N04-1022.6 . We describe a hierarchy of N04-1022.7 that incorporate different levels of N04-1022.8 from N04-1022.9 , N04-1022.10 from an N04-1022.11 , and N04-1022.12 from N04-1022.13 of N04-1022.14 . We report the N04-1022.15 of the N04-1022.16 on a N04-1022.17 . Our results show that N04-1022.18 can be used to tune N04-1022.19 for specific N04-1022.20 .
N04-4028.1 automatically create N04-4028.2 from N04-4028.3 , such as the Web or N04-4028.4 . Despite the successes of these systems, N04-4028.5 will always be imperfect. For many reasons, it is highly desirable to accurately estimate the N04-4028.6 the system has in the correctness of each N04-4028.7 . The N04-4028.8 we evaluate is based on a N04-4028.9 , a N04-4028.10 which has performed well on N04-4028.11 because of its ability to capture arbitrary, overlapping N04-4028.12 of the N04-4028.13 in a N04-4028.14 . We implement several techniques to estimate the N04-4028.15 of both N04-4028.16 and entire N04-4028.17 , obtaining an N04-4028.18 of 98% for retrieving correct N04-4028.19 and 87% for multi-field records.
The M92-1025.1 is a set of M92-1025.2 designed to be easily adapted to new M92-1025.3 . This report summarizes the system and its performance on the M92-1025.4 .
This paper presents a P05-1028.1 that explores the extent to which captions contribute to recognizing the intended message of an P05-1028.2 . It then presents an implemented P05-1028.3 that takes into account a variety of P05-1028.4 , and an evaluation study showing that evidence obtained from P05-1028.5 of the graphic's caption has a significant impact on the system's success. This work is part of a larger project whose goal is to provide P05-1028.6 with effective access to P05-1028.7 .
We present a framework for P05-1057.1 based on P05-1057.2 . All P05-1057.3 are treated as P05-1057.4 , which depend on the P05-1057.5 , the P05-1057.6 and possible additional variables. P05-1057.7 allow P05-1057.8 to be easily extended by incorporating P05-1057.9 . In this paper, we use P05-1057.10 , P05-1057.11 , and P05-1057.12 as P05-1057.13 . Our experiments show that P05-1057.14 significantly outperform P05-1057.15 .
This paper presents the results of automatically inducing a P05-2013.1 from a P05-2013.2 . The fact that P05-2013.3 is an P05-2013.4 presents a challenge for P05-2013.5 . We explored possible ways to obtain a P05-2013.6 , consistent with P05-2013.7 , from a P05-2013.8 which is an order of magnitude smaller than P05-2013.9 .
In the I05-2044.1 , a I05-2044.2 may have its I05-2044.3 on its left, right or on both sides. The I05-2044.4 of I05-2044.5 is essential for I05-2044.6 of I05-2044.7 with two or more I05-2044.8 . Previous works on I05-2044.9 may not guarantee the I05-2044.10 of a I05-2044.11 due to their weakness at resolving the I05-2044.12 . This paper proposes a I05-2044.13 based on I05-2044.14 . The I05-2044.15 and I05-2044.16 are detected in Phase I, and I05-2044.17 are decided in Phase II. In experimental evaluation, our proposed method outperforms previous I05-2044.18 for the I05-2044.19 , showing improvement of I05-2044.20 by 10.08%.
We present an operable definition of E99-1038.1 which is argued to be of a cognito-pragmatic nature and explore how it is determined in E99-1038.2 in a formalized manner. For this purpose, a file card model of E99-1038.3 and E99-1038.4 is introduced enabling the E99-1038.5 and E99-1038.6 of its E99-1038.7 as a programmable algorithm ( E99-1038.8 ). Interdisciplinary evidence from social and cognitive psychology is cited and the prospect of the integration of E99-1038.9 via E99-1038.10 as a E99-1038.11 into E99-1038.12 , in particular, E99-1038.13 , is also briefly discussed.
Currently several E87-1037.1 converge towards being declarative and towards utilizing E87-1037.2 as a backbone, e.g. E87-1037.3 and E87-1037.4 . Typically the processing of these formalisms is organized within a E87-1037.5 . The declarative character of the E87-1037.6 makes it important to decide upon an overall E87-1037.7 on the part of the processor. In particular, this brings the E87-1037.8 into critical focus: to gain maximal E87-1037.9 , one has to determine the best way of putting the E87-1037.10 to use. The aim of this paper is to provide a survey and a practical comparison of fundamental E87-1037.11 within E87-1037.12 .
In this paper I will argue for a E91-1043.1 that is based on E91-1043.2 and E91-1043.3 . The main E91-1043.4 of this model is to view E91-1043.5 and E91-1043.6 as two strongly interleaved tasks performed by a single E91-1043.7 process. It will be shown that this view supports flexible and efficient E91-1043.8 .
One of the major problems one is faced with when decomposing E93-1023.1 into their E93-1023.2 is E93-1023.3 : the E93-1023.4 of multiple E93-1023.5 for one E93-1023.6 , many of which are implausible. In order to deal with E93-1023.7 , the E93-1023.8 is provided with a E93-1023.9 , i.e. it combines a E93-1023.10 to filter out E93-1023.11 with a E93-1023.12 which determines the likelihood of each successful E93-1023.13 . Consequently, remaining E93-1023.14 can be ordered along a scale of plausibility. Test performance data will show that a E93-1023.15 yields good results in E93-1023.16 . E93-1023.17 is a fully implemented E93-1023.18 developed for use in a E93-1023.19 .
This paper presents a I05-3022.1 in France Telecom R&amp;D Beijing, which uses a unified approach to I05-3022.2 and I05-3022.3 . The I05-3022.4 can be customized to meet different I05-3022.5 through the application of an ordered list of transformation. The I05-3022.6 participated in all the tracks of the I05-3022.7 -- I05-3022.8 , I05-3022.9 , I05-3022.10 , I05-3022.11 , I05-3022.12 , I05-3022.13 , I05-3022.14 and I05-3022.15 -- and achieved the I05-3022.16 in I05-3022.17 , I05-3022.18 and I05-3022.19 tracks. Analysis of the results shows that each component of the system contributed to the I05-3022.20 .
In this paper a E93-1043.1 with a limited capability to automatically interpret (and generate) E93-1043.2 is presented. The system combines an extended E93-1043.3 [Trost, 1991a; Trost, 1991b] with a E93-1043.4 building on a E93-1043.5 . E93-1043.6 not explicitly stored in the E93-1043.7 are given a E93-1043.8 . That way the system allows to minimize redundancy in the E93-1043.9 because E93-1043.10 that are transparent need not to be stored explicitly. Also, E93-1043.11 can be recognized correctly. The system is implemented in CommonLisp and has been tested on examples from E93-1043.12 .
This paper proposes an approach to E99-1014.1 suitable for E99-1014.2 from E99-1014.3 . Sequences of cascades of E99-1014.4 deterministically analyze the E99-1014.5 , building E99-1014.6 . Initially basic E99-1014.7 are analyzed; then E99-1014.8 are recognized; finally E99-1014.9 is performed and the E99-1014.10 is built. The approach was proven to work for three E99-1014.11 and different E99-1014.12 . It was implemented in the E99-1014.13 of E99-1014.14 .
The following describes recent work on the H91-1010.1 . Some new variations in H91-1010.2 have been tested. A very simple improved H91-1010.3 has reduced the H91-1010.4 by about 10% in both H91-1010.5 . A new H91-1010.6 has been tested which, by itself, did not provide useful improvements but suggests that improvements can be obtained by a related rapid adaptation technique. Finally, the H91-1010.7 has been modified to use H91-1010.8 . The system was then transferred from the H91-1010.9 to the H91-1010.10 and a limited number of development tests performed. Evaluation test results are presented for both the H91-1010.11 .
A97-1020.1 is designed to support reading and learning to read in a foreign A97-1020.2 . There are four A97-1020.3 currently supported by A97-1020.4 : A97-1020.5 , A97-1020.6 , A97-1020.7 and A97-1020.8 . The program is operational on UNIX and Windows '95 platforms, and has undergone a pilot user-study. A demonstration (in UNIX) for A97-1020.9 emphasizes components put to novel technical uses in A97-1020.10 , including A97-1020.11 and A97-1020.12 for an A97-1020.13 of A97-1020.14 .
This paper addresses the problem of identifying likely A97-1042.1 of A97-1042.2 by their position in the A97-1042.3 . It describes the automated A97-1042.4 and evaluation of an A97-1042.5 , a method of locating the likely positions of A97-1042.6 based on A97-1042.7 of A97-1042.8 . This method can be used in applications such as A97-1042.9 , A97-1042.10 , and A97-1042.11 .
We describe a new method for the representation of H05-1064.1 within H05-1064.2 . We make use of a H05-1064.3 , with H05-1064.4 representing the H05-1064.5 of H05-1064.6 to H05-1064.7 or H05-1064.8 . The model learns to automatically make these H05-1064.9 based on a H05-1064.10 . H05-1064.11 and H05-1064.12 with the model requires summing over an exponential number of H05-1064.13 : the required summations can be computed efficiently and exactly using H05-1064.14 . As a case study, we apply the model to H05-1064.15 . The model gives an H05-1064.16 of ~1.25% beyond the H05-1064.17 , and an ~0.25% improvement beyond H05-1064.18 . Although our experiments are focused on H05-1064.19 , the techniques described generalize naturally to H05-1064.20 other than H05-1064.21 .
I05-4008.1 contains I05-4008.2 transcribed from about 330 hours of I05-4008.3 of fourteen young children from I05-4008.4 speaking families in Taiwan. The format of the I05-4008.5 adopts the I05-4008.6 . The size of the I05-4008.7 is about 1.6 million I05-4008.8 . In this paper, we describe I05-4008.9 , I05-4008.10 , I05-4008.11 , and I05-4008.12 of this I05-4008.13 . Applications of the I05-4008.14 are also discussed.
Robust P81-1032.1 requires strong P81-1032.2 , P81-1032.3 , and very flexible P81-1032.4 . Although P81-1032.5 have met with a measure of success, a P81-1032.6 is shown to provide a much higher degree of flexibility, redundancy, and ability to bring P81-1032.7 (in addition to P81-1032.8 ) to bear on both P81-1032.9 . A P81-1032.10 is presented that integrates several different P81-1032.11 , with P81-1032.12 dominating. Each of these P81-1032.13 exploits different P81-1032.14 ; and their combination provides a strong framework in which to process P81-1032.15 , P81-1032.16 , and P81-1032.17 , as well as less exotic, P81-1032.18 . Several P81-1032.19 for handling P81-1032.20 are presented within this P81-1032.21 .
By generalizing the notion of P85-1015.1 to allow P85-1015.2 , one can describe the P85-1015.3 of P85-1015.4 . These P85-1015.5 can be described by a variant of P85-1015.6 , and these P85-1015.7 can be used in conjunction with a P85-1015.8 to create a P85-1015.9 .
A system is described for acquiring a P91-1016.1 which is applied by a P91-1016.2 . The P91-1016.3 was based on P91-1016.4 and a high degree of success in P91-1016.5 is reported. Overall, this research concludes that P91-1016.6 is a computationally and conceptually tractable approach to the construction of P91-1016.7 for P91-1016.8 .
We present a P95-1027.1 of methods that have been proposed in the P95-1027.2 for selecting the P95-1027.3 out of a pair of P95-1027.4 . Solutions to this problem are applicable to the more general task of selecting the positive P95-1027.5 from the pair. Using P95-1027.6 , the P95-1027.7 and applicability of each method is quantified, and a P95-1027.8 of the significance of the results is performed. We show that some simple methods are indeed good indicators for the answer to the problem while other proposed methods fail to perform better than would be attributable to chance. In addition, one of the simplest methods, P95-1027.9 , dominates all others. We also apply two P95-1027.10 for combining the indications of the individual methods, and compare their performance to the simple methods. The most sophisticated P95-1027.11 offers a small, but statistically significant, improvement over the original tests.
In the past the evaluation of P97-1015.1 has focused on single system evaluations because there were only few systems available. But now there are several commercial systems for the same P97-1015.2 . This requires new methods of comparative evaluation. In the paper we propose a P97-1015.3 for comparing the P97-1015.4 of P97-1015.5 . The method is based on lists of P97-1015.6 from different P97-1015.7 . It is shown how these P97-1015.8 can be compiled and used for testing. We also present the results of using our method on 6 P97-1015.9 that translate between P97-1015.10 and P97-1015.11 .
We describe a method for interpreting P97-1052.1 , as P97-1052.2 . The method establishes a P97-1052.3 between subsets of the P97-1052.4 and P97-1052.5 formalisms. It provides a P97-1052.6 and an P97-1052.7 which operates directly on P97-1052.8 for P97-1052.9 through the P97-1052.10 of P97-1052.11 as P97-1052.12 .
In this paper we describe a systematic approach for creating a P99-1025.1 based on a P99-1025.2 , a P99-1025.3 on a P99-1025.4 . These P99-1025.5 are P99-1025.6 for building higher level abstractions called P99-1025.7 . The P99-1025.8 , consisting of a P99-1025.9 , is entirely built using the P99-1025.10 .
P99-1068.1 (Resnik, 1998) is a P99-1068.2 for P99-1068.3 in P99-1068.4 on the World Wide Web. This paper extends the preliminary P99-1068.5 results by adding P99-1068.6 , scaling up by orders of magnitude, and formally evaluating performance. The most recent end-product is an P99-1068.7 comprising 2491 P99-1068.8 , approximately 1.5 million P99-1068.9 per P99-1068.10 .
The project presented here is a part of a long term research program aiming at a full L08-1260.1 . The main of this project is L08-1260.2 in L08-1260.3 . We present methodology and resources obtained in three main project phases which are: L08-1260.4 of L08-1260.5 , feasibility study for L08-1260.6 phase, L08-1260.7 and L08-1260.8 . In this paper we focus on the results of the third phase. The presented here L08-1260.9 permitted us to triple the size the L08-1260.10 . In the paper we describe the L08-1260.11 and announce some future research intended to be a separate project continuation.
In this paper we deal with a recently developed L08-1540.1 containing at the moment 160 000 L08-1540.2 (treated as L08-1540.3 ). It was compiled from various resources such as L08-1540.4 and L08-1540.5 , public L08-1540.6 of L08-1540.7 and L08-1540.8 , L08-1540.9 obtained from L08-1540.10 , lists of L08-1540.11 and others. We describe the structure of the L08-1540.12 and give basic types of L08-1540.13 according to domains they belong to. We compare the built L08-1540.14 with the L08-1540.15 from L08-1540.16 (approx. 100 mil. tokens) and present results of this comparison in the paper. These L08-1540.17 have not been obtained from the L08-1540.18 since their frequencies in it are rather low. To obtain a more complete list of L08-1540.19 we propose and use a technique exploiting the L08-1540.20 , which allows us to work with L08-1540.21 such as frequency of L08-1540.22 and their components as well as with the L08-1540.23 for the whole L08-1540.24 . We also discuss exploitation of the L08-1540.25 for working out a more adequate L08-1540.26 and L08-1540.27 . The final goal is to be able to recognize L08-1540.28 in L08-1540.29 and lemmatize them as complete L08-1540.30 , i. e. to make L08-1540.31 and L08-1540.32 more adequate.
We describe a set of experiments to explore L08-1110.1 for ranking and selecting the best L08-1110.2 in a L08-1110.3 of L08-1110.4 . In a previous paper (Carl, 2007) we have described how the L08-1110.5 is generated through L08-1110.6 and L08-1110.7 . We have given examples of its L08-1110.8 consisting of L08-1110.9 of L08-1110.10 and L08-1110.11 . This paper describes a number of methods for elaborating L08-1110.12 from some of the L08-1110.13 . The L08-1110.14 are trained off-line on different types of L08-1110.15 and their L08-1110.16 is then used to retrieve the best M L08-1110.17 in the L08-1110.18 . We compare two L08-1110.19 , the L08-1110.20 and the L08-1110.21 and arrive at three results: 1) L08-1110.22 produce better results than L08-1110.23 , 2) adding a L08-1110.24 to the L08-1110.25 improves the output and 3) L08-1110.26 for L08-1110.27 are suitable if the L08-1110.28 is similar to the L08-1110.29 to be translated.
Existing techniques extract L08-1154.1 by looking for L08-1154.2 associated with L08-1154.3 . The algorithms always face the dilemma that fewer L08-1154.4 are not enough to distinguish L08-1154.5 from L08-1154.6 whereas more L08-1154.7 lead to more conflicts among selected L08-1154.8 . This paper presents a novel approach for L08-1154.9 based on L08-1154.10 which are much more stable and domain independent. The proposed approach is not as sensitive to L08-1154.11 as that of previous works. This approach has no strict limit or L08-1154.12 and thus they can deal with all kinds of L08-1154.13 . It also requires no prior L08-1154.14 and no additional L08-1154.15 to adapt to new L08-1154.16 . Consequently, the proposed approach can be applied to different L08-1154.17 easily and it is especially useful for L08-1154.18 . Evaluations conducted on two different L08-1154.19 for L08-1154.20 show significant improvements over existing techniques which verifies its efficiency and domain independent nature. Experiments on L08-1154.21 indicate that the proposed approach can also serve as an effective tool for L08-1154.22 .
The present paper reports on a preparatory research for building a L08-1050.1 capturing the L08-1050.2 in L08-1050.3 . We primarily focus on the description of the L08-1050.4 in L08-1050.5 , basing our findings on the theoretical background of the L08-1050.6 and the L08-1050.7 . Our aim is to revisit the present-day L08-1050.8 in the L08-1050.9 , extend it for the purposes of a L08-1050.10 and eventually to design a new, L08-1050.11 of L08-1050.12 . In this paper, we propose a feasible process of such a transfer, comparing the possibilities the L08-1050.13 offers with the L08-1050.14 based primarily on the analysis and classification of L08-1050.15 .
In this paper, we reported experiments of L08-1097.1 of L08-1097.2 from L08-1097.3 . The proposed technique operates on L08-1097.4 on the basis of a limited number of L08-1097.5 not relying on any previous L08-1097.6 about L08-1097.7 . Although preliminary, reported results are in line with L08-1097.8 . The issue of whether L08-1097.9 sharing similar L08-1097.10 happen to share L08-1097.11 as well was also explored by clustering L08-1097.12 that share L08-1097.13 with the same L08-1097.14 using the L08-1097.15 . First experiments in this direction were carried out on L08-1097.16 with encouraging results.
The N04-2005.1 of N04-2005.2 into N04-2005.3 tests the limits of N04-2005.4 . A new N04-2005.5 is proposed that uses N04-2005.6 to produce N04-2005.7 called " N04-2005.8 ." The model acts as an N04-2005.9 within a new N04-2005.10 that also incorporates N04-2005.11 and N04-2005.12 into a single system.
In our current research into the design of A92-1010.1 relying primarily on the A92-1010.2 , we have observed that A92-1010.3 alone does not provide sufficient support to users - particularly when situations arise that do not simply conform to the users' expectations. This can occur due to too much A92-1010.4 being requested, too little, A92-1010.5 of the wrong kind, etc. To solve this problem, we are working towards the integration of A92-1010.6 to augment the A92-1010.7
A major axis of research at LIMSI is directed at H94-1064.1 . In this paper the H94-1064.2 which was evaluated in the H94-1064.3 is described, and experimental results on the H94-1064.4 under closely matched conditions are reported. For both H94-1064.5  H94-1064.6 were carried out with H94-1064.7 containing up to 20k H94-1064.8 . The recognizer makes use of H94-1064.9 with H94-1064.10 for H94-1064.11 and H94-1064.12 estimated on the H94-1064.13 for H94-1064.14 . The recognizer uses a H94-1064.15 which is shown to still be viable with a 20k-word vocabulary when used with H94-1064.16 . A second H94-1064.17 , which makes use of a H94-1064.18 generated with the H94-1064.19 , incorporates a H94-1064.20 . H94-1064.21 uses H94-1064.22 , H94-1064.23 , H94-1064.24 , and H94-1064.25 .
This paper introduces a A00-1024.1 . The A00-1024.2 is based on a A00-1024.3 where each A00-1024.4 is responsible for identifying one class of A00-1024.5 . The focus of this paper is the A00-1024.6 that identify A00-1024.7 and A00-1024.8 . Each A00-1024.9 uses a A00-1024.10 to combine multiple types of A00-1024.11 about the A00-1024.12 . The A00-1024.13 is evaluated using data from A00-1024.14 - a genre replete with a wide variety of A00-1024.15 .
X96-1059.1 in X96-1059.2 has been studied as a part of the more general problem of X96-1059.3 in X96-1059.4 ([1] [2]). It has also been studied in the framework of X96-1059.5 ([3]) in recent years. Our approach to the Multi-lingual Evaluation Task (MET) for X96-1059.6 is to consider the given task as a X96-1059.7 in X96-1059.8 . Our X96-1059.9 has done all the necessary work for the X96-1059.10 in the X96-1059.11 . The X96-1059.12 is called "Amorph". Amorph recognizes X96-1059.13 in two stages: X96-1059.14 and X96-1059.15 . First, it uses several kinds of X96-1059.16 to segment and tag X96-1059.17 . Second, based on the information resulting from the X96-1059.18 , a set of X96-1059.19 is applied to the X96-1059.20 in order to identify X96-1059.21 . When a X96-1059.22 is found to be an X96-1059.23 , this information is added to the X96-1059.24 and it is used to generate the final output.
We present a H05-1041.1 to produce H05-1041.2 to H05-1041.3 in H05-1041.4 that supplement H05-1041.5 . The method exploits H05-1041.6 to generate automatically an arbitrarily large number of H05-1041.7 , which are then used to train an H05-1041.8 to separate the two classes. We show experimentally that the proposed method is viable, that it outperforms the alternative of training the H05-1041.9 on H05-1041.10 and H05-1041.11 , and that it helps the H05-1041.12 handle H05-1041.13 significantly better.
W02-1403.1 has been the subject of much work in the context of W02-1403.2 extracted from W02-1403.3 : given a set of W02-1403.4 , obtained from an existing resource or extracted from a W02-1403.5 , identifying W02-1403.6 between these W02-1403.7 . The present paper focusses on W02-1403.8 by W02-1403.9 , which match W02-1403.10 on the basis on their W02-1403.11 , taking W02-1403.12 into account. Experiments are done on a 'flat' list of W02-1403.13 obtained from an originally W02-1403.14 : the French version of the W02-1403.15 . We compare the W02-1403.16 with the original W02-1403.17 : after a quantitative evaluation of their congruence through W02-1403.18 , we perform a qualitative, human analysis ofthe 'new' W02-1403.19 not present in the W02-1403.20 . This analysis shows, on the one hand, the limits of the W02-1403.21 . On the other hand, it also reveals some specific structuring choices and W02-1403.22 made by the W02-1403.23 designers, and emphasizes ontological commitments that cannot be left to W02-1403.24 .
In this study, we propose a W02-1404.1 for aligning W02-1404.2 and thus extracting W02-1404.3 from a W02-1404.4 consisting of W02-1404.5 from Hong Kong. With a W02-1404.6 , W02-1404.7 are suggested by analysing the W02-1404.8 of W02-1404.9 . The method overcomes the limitations of W02-1404.10 which require W02-1404.11 to be effective, and W02-1404.12 which depend on existing W02-1404.13 . Pilot testing on a W02-1404.14 of about 113K W02-1404.15 and 120K W02-1404.16 gives an encouraging 85% W02-1404.17 and 45% W02-1404.18 . Future work includes fine-tuning the W02-1404.19 upon the analysis of the errors, and acquiring a W02-1404.20 for W02-1404.21 by filtering out W02-1404.22 .
W02-1602.1 of a W02-1602.2 and its representation in some W02-1602.3 seems the best and simplest way to share W02-1602.4 across W02-1602.5 . For various reasons, W02-1602.6 are the best candidates in this context. We are developing a W02-1602.7 where, in the simplest W02-1602.8 , naive users interact directly with the W02-1602.9 in their W02-1602.10 , and indirectly with the associated W02-1602.11 . The modified W02-1602.12 is then sent to the W02-1602.13 and the result shown. If is is satisfactory, the errors were probably due to the W02-1602.14 , not to the W02-1602.15 , and the W02-1602.16 is sent to W02-1602.17 in other W02-1602.18 . Versions in some other W02-1602.19 known by the user may be displayed, so that improvement sharing is visible and encouraging. As new versions are added with appropriate W02-1602.20 and W02-1602.21 in the W02-1602.22 , nothing is ever lost, and cooperative working on a W02-1602.23 is rendered feasible. On the internal side, liaisons are established between elements of the W02-1602.24 and the W02-1602.25 by using broadly available resources such as a W02-1602.26 , a W02-1602.27 , and a W02-1602.28 . Establishing a "best" correspondence between the " W02-1602.29 " and the " W02-1602.30 ", a W02-1602.31 , may be done using the W02-1602.32 and trying to align the W02-1602.33 and the selected W02-1602.34 with as few W02-1602.35 as possible. A central goal of this research is to merge approaches from W02-1602.36 , W02-1602.37 , and W02-1602.38 .
In this paper, we improve an W03-0406.1 using the W03-0406.2 proposed by Nigam et al. for W03-0406.3 in order to apply it to W03-0406.4 . The improved method stops the W03-0406.5 at the W03-0406.6 . To estimate that number, we propose two methods. In experiments, we solved 50 W03-0406.7 in the W03-0406.8 . The score of our method is a match for the best public score of this task. Furthermore, our methods were confirmed to be effective also for W03-0406.9 .
In this paper we discuss a proposed W99-0408.1 for the W99-0408.2 , a W99-0408.3 for deaf learners of W99-0408.4 . The model will represent the W99-0408.5 of the user and is designed to be referenced during both W99-0408.6 and W99-0408.7 . We motivate our W99-0408.8 by citing relevant research on W99-0408.9 , and briefly discuss preliminary empirical evidence supporting the W99-0408.10 . We conclude by showing how our W99-0408.11 can provide a rich and W99-0408.12 to a language assessment / correction application by modeling W99-0408.13 at a high level of granularity and specificity.
This paper describes novel and practical P98-1083.1 that uses P98-1083.2 . First, we construct a single P98-1083.3 to estimate P98-1083.4 ; how one P98-1083.5 tends to modify another. Next, we introduce a P98-1083.6 in which several P98-1083.7 are constructed and then combined for P98-1083.8 . The two constructed P98-1083.9 are evaluated by using the P98-1083.10 . The single-tree method outperforms the P98-1083.11 by 4%. Moreover, the boosting version is shown to have significant advantages; 1) better P98-1083.12 than its single-tree counterpart for any amount of P98-1083.13 and 2) no P98-1083.14 for various P98-1083.15 .
I08-1027.1 of I08-1027.2 oriented for I08-1027.3 is addressed. Since the I08-1027.4 of I08-1027.5 differs in I08-1027.6 , I08-1027.7 has been evaluated based on I08-1027.8 , which gives a I08-1027.9 on errors from the viewpoint of I08-1027.10 , instead of I08-1027.11 , which treats all I08-1027.12 uniformly. A I08-1027.13 that minimizes I08-1027.14 based on a I08-1027.15 has been shown, and the reduction of errors on both I08-1027.16 and I08-1027.17 has been reported. In this paper, we propose an I08-1027.18 for I08-1027.19 based on its influence on I08-1027.20 . Specifically, I08-1027.21 are estimated so that I08-1027.22 of I08-1027.23 and I08-1027.24 are equivalent. We apply the proposed method to a I08-1027.25 , which is a typical I08-1027.26 , and show that the method works well.
This study presents a I08-1043.1 using I08-1043.2 , which utilizes the I08-1043.3 obtained by projecting a I08-1043.4 onto the other language sentence based on I08-1043.5 . Since the I08-1043.6 is capable of clearly disambiguating the I08-1043.7 of an original I08-1043.8 using the I08-1043.9 of I08-1043.10 , it would be possible to obtain interchangeable I08-1043.11 under a given I08-1043.12 . Also, we provide an advanced method to acquire I08-1043.13 using the extracted I08-1043.14 . We applied the method to acquire the I08-1043.15 for I08-1043.16 . Through experiments with I08-1043.17 of a I08-1043.18 , we show that our I08-1043.19 effectively extracts I08-1043.20 with high I08-1043.21 , 94.3% and 84.6% respectively for I08-1043.22 and I08-1043.23 , and the I08-1043.24 extracted from the I08-1043.25 could be generalized successfully using the I08-1043.26 with the 12.5% I08-1043.27 .
This paper describes a W04-1307.1 of W04-1307.2 and presents simulation results on W04-1307.3 . In particular, we explore the capacity and limitations of W04-1307.4 that have recently gained prominence in W04-1307.5 and W04-1307.6 .
In this paper, we show how to construct a W04-2204.1 automatically. W04-2204.2 , one of the most difficult tasks in developing a W04-2204.3 , is expensive. To avoid this problem, we investigate how we build a W04-2204.4 using existing W04-2204.5 . Our W04-2204.6 can be applied to any W04-2204.7 , but for the present we focus on building a W04-2204.8 using W04-2204.9 as a W04-2204.10 . We attempt three ways of W04-2204.11 to corroborate the effect of the W04-2204.12 of W04-2204.13 . First, we introduce W04-2204.14 using a W04-2204.15 . Second, we show a method using W04-2204.16 with a W04-2204.17 and an W04-2204.18 . Third, we consider another alternative method rarely used for building a W04-2204.19 : an W04-2204.20 and W04-2204.21 . We found that the first method is the most effective and the best result can be obtained from combining the three methods.
This paper describes a new, W04-2703.1 project - the W04-2703.2 . We present an approach to annotating a level of W04-2703.3 that is based on identifying W04-2703.4 and their W04-2703.5 . The W04-2703.6 is being built directly on top of the W04-2703.7 and W04-2703.8 , thus supporting the extraction of useful W04-2703.9 and providing a richer substrate for the development and evaluation of W04-2703.10 . We provide a detailed preliminary analysis of W04-2703.11 - both the W04-2703.12 and the types of W04-2703.13 .
In this paper, we present a W05-1308.1 , named W05-1308.2 , to identify W05-1308.3 in W05-1308.4 . Our approach is based on first splitting W05-1308.5 into W05-1308.6 made up of W05-1308.7 . Then, tagging W05-1308.8 with the help of W05-1308.9 . Finally, extracting W05-1308.10 by analyzing the matching contents of W05-1308.11 and their linguistically significant combinations. Our W05-1308.12 handles W05-1308.13 and extracts W05-1308.14 specified in a W05-1308.15 . Experimental evaluations with two other state of the art W05-1308.16 indicate that the W05-1308.17 achieves better W05-1308.18 without the labor intensive W05-1308.19 .
We propose a framework to derive the W06-1605.1 between W06-1605.2 from W06-1605.3 . We use the W06-1605.4 in a published W06-1605.5 as W06-1605.6 , allowing all possible W06-1605.7 to be stored in a W06-1605.8 roughly.01% the size of that created by existing measures. We show that the newly proposed W06-1605.9 outperform W06-1605.10 in the tasks of (1) ranking W06-1605.11 in order of W06-1605.12 , and (2) correcting W06-1605.13 . In the latter task, of all the W06-1605.14 , only that proposed by Jiang and Conrath outperforms the best W06-1605.15 .
We argue in favor of the the use of W07-0208.1 to represent various types of W07-0208.2 , and illustrate how this allows one to view W07-0208.3 as W07-0208.4 . We present a general method for learning such W07-0208.5 from an W07-0208.6 and describe experiments with two applications of the method: W07-0208.7 (using W07-0208.8 ) and W07-0208.9 (using W07-0208.10 ).
P08-1105.1 is the task of ranking P08-1105.2 with respect to their P08-1105.3 for a given P08-1105.4 . To improve P08-1105.5 we incorporate P08-1105.6 in the P08-1105.7 . We consider two groups of P08-1105.8 : post level (determined using information about individual P08-1105.9 only) and blog level (determined using information from the underlying P08-1105.10 ). We describe how to estimate these P08-1105.11 and how to integrate them into a P08-1105.12 based on P08-1105.13 . Experiments on the P08-1105.14 show that both groups of P08-1105.15 significantly improve P08-1105.16 ; the best performance is achieved when combining them.
P08-2034.1 seeks to assign songs appropriate P08-2034.2 such as light-hearted heavy-hearted. Four problems render P08-2034.3 ineffective: 1) Many P08-2034.4 within P08-2034.5 actually contribute little to P08-2034.6 ; 2) P08-2034.7 and P08-2034.8 used to express P08-2034.9 are ambiguous; 3) P08-2034.10 and P08-2034.11 around the P08-2034.12 make particular contributions to P08-2034.13 ; 4) P08-2034.14 is usually very short. To address these problems, the P08-2034.15 is proposed to represent P08-2034.16 . The preliminary experiments prove that the P08-2034.17 outperforms the P08-2034.18 in the P08-2034.19 .
This paper shows that it is very often possible to identify the C08-1118.1 of medium-length speeches in the C08-1118.2 on the basis of C08-1118.3 of C08-1118.4 (87.2%-96.7% C08-1118.5 depending on C08-1118.6 ). The paper also examines in detail which C08-1118.7 are most powerful and identifies a number of linguistic aspects as well as culture- and domain-related ones.
C08-1128.1 in C08-1128.2 are not naturally separated by C08-1128.3 , which poses a challenge to C08-1128.4 . In C08-1128.5 , the widely used approach is to apply a C08-1128.6 trained from C08-1128.7 , using a fixed C08-1128.8 . Such C08-1128.9 is not necessarily optimal for C08-1128.10 . We propose a C08-1128.11 which uses both C08-1128.12 to derive a C08-1128.13 suitable for C08-1128.14 . Experiments show that our method improves a C08-1128.15 in a small and a C08-1128.16 .
C08-2010.1 is crucial in C08-2010.2 . Many of the resources used are derived from data created by human beings out of an C08-2010.3 context, especially regarding C08-2010.4 and C08-2010.5 . Indeed, C08-2010.6 need C08-2010.7 that allow the comparison of both C08-2010.8 . The validation of these resources is widely recommended before being used. This paper describes the impact of using C08-2010.9 on C08-2010.10 . Surprisingly enough, similar scores are obtained in many cases regardless of the quality. Thus, the limitations of the C08-2010.11 used within C08-2010.12 are also discussed in this regard.
In this paper, we will describe a C08-3010.1 for a huge set of C08-3010.2 . The tool supports C08-3010.3 with an arbitrary number of C08-3010.4 . It takes a fraction of a second for a search, and can provide the C08-3010.5 of the C08-3010.6 . The system runs on a single Linux PC with reasonable size C08-3010.7 (less than 4GB) and C08-3010.8 (less than 400GB). This system can be a very useful tool for C08-3010.9 and other C08-3010.10 .
This paper presents an approach to the W03-2907.1 of W03-2907.2 which uses both W03-2907.3 . While the W03-2907.4 is more complex than those which have been employed for W03-2907.5 of W03-2907.6 , which use only W03-2907.7 , the variety of W03-2907.8 in the world requires that we consider W03-2907.9 as well. In many W03-2907.10 , W03-2907.11 provides better clues to a word's category than W03-2907.12 . We present the W03-2907.13 for W03-2907.14 , and present results for applying it to W03-2907.15 , a W03-2907.16 with relatively W03-2907.17 and W03-2907.18 .
We propose a solution to the challenge of the W08-2122.1 that uses a W08-2122.2 to predict the most likely W08-2122.3 of a W08-2122.4 for both W08-2122.5 . The submitted W08-2122.6 yields 79.1% W08-2122.7 , for the joint task, 86.9% W08-2122.8 and 71.0% W08-2122.9 . A larger W08-2122.10 trained after the deadline achieves 80.5% W08-2122.11 , 87.6% W08-2122.12 , and 73.1% W08-2122.13 .
P03-1034.1 have grown increasingly complex as P03-1034.2 were added to support P03-1034.3 such as P03-1034.4 , P03-1034.5 , and P03-1034.6 . This has given rise to discussions about the relative placement of these new P03-1034.7 in the overall P03-1034.8 . Recent work on another aspect of P03-1034.9 , P03-1034.10 , indicates it is time to consider where a P03-1034.11 fits in. We present examples which suggest that in a P03-1034.12 , the best approach is to strongly tie it to a P03-1034.13 . Finally, we evaluate the approach in a working P03-1034.14 .
With performance above 97% P06-1088.1 for P06-1088.2 , P06-1088.3 might be considered a solved problem. Previous studies have shown that allowing the P06-1088.4 to resolve P06-1088.5 does not improve performance. However, for P06-1088.6 which use more P06-1088.7 , for example P06-1088.8 and P06-1088.9 , P06-1088.10 is much lower. In fact, for these P06-1088.11 , premature P06-1088.12 makes P06-1088.13 infeasible. We describe a P06-1088.14 which maintains a suitable level of P06-1088.15 for accurate and efficient P06-1088.16 . We extend this P06-1088.17 to the P06-1088.18 to overcome errors introduced by automatically assigned P06-1088.19 . Although P06-1088.20 seems high, maintaining some P06-1088.21 in the P06-1088.22 results in more accurate P06-1088.23 .
Both P06-3008.1 and P06-3008.2 have been helpful in P06-3008.3 . Based on a P06-3008.4 , this paper reports the P06-3008.5 of 6 P06-3008.6 in P06-3008.7 : P06-3008.8 , P06-3008.9 , P06-3008.10 , P06-3008.11 , P06-3008.12 , and P06-3008.13 . The P06-3008.14 of these marks are compared against P06-3008.15 around P06-3008.16 in general. Results show that these P06-3008.17 , though fewer in number than P06-3008.18 , are easy to identify, have strong correlation with certain relations, and can be used as distinctive indicators of nuclearity in P06-3008.19 .
This paper examines the properties of C90-3007.1 built on top of C90-3007.2 . We show that the crucial operation of C90-3007.3 for such descriptions is NP-complete, and therefore probably intractable, but proceed to develop C90-3007.4 which can sometimes alleviate the unpleasant consequences of this C90-3007.5 .
This paper presents an algorithm for selecting an appropriate C94-1091.1 for a C94-1091.2 . In C94-1091.3 , it frequently happens that there is fluctuation in the choice of C94-1091.4 for a given C94-1091.5 , both from the point of view of the whole C94-1091.6 and C94-1091.7 . Basically, there is no exact rule for C94-1091.8 . As far as we can do in the C94-1091.9 is to give a C94-1091.10 to pick up a corresponding C94-1091.11 of each C94-1091.12 . Registration of C94-1091.13 for each C94-1091.14 is limited to the C94-1091.15 because other types are open due to the meaning of representation. We propose a C94-1091.16 (Biber,1993; Nagao,1993; Smadja,1993) which generates C94-1091.17 to overcome the problems in C94-1091.18 and C94-1091.19 . The C94-1091.20 is created statistically from a large C94-1091.21 and recomposed under C94-1091.22 and C94-1091.23 .
This paper describes an C02-1120.1 for C02-1120.2 , which is important in developing reliable C02-1120.3 . Consider the situation that a user gives a C02-1120.4 "How much petrol was imported to Japan from Saudi Arabia?" to a C02-1120.5 , but the C02-1120.6 given to the system includes only the C02-1120.7 "X tonnes of petrol was conveyed to Japan from Saudi Arabia". We think that the C02-1120.8 is a good clue to find the answer for our C02-1120.9 , "X tonnes". But there is no C02-1120.10 that provides the C02-1120.11 between "imported" and "conveyed". Our aim is to develop an C02-1120.12 that can obtain such an C02-1120.13 , which we call C02-1120.14 . The method we are currently working on uses an C02-1120.15 , and we have evaluated the effectiveness of this method using C02-1120.16 .
C04-1022.1 remains a challenging task, in particular for C04-1022.2 . Recently, new approaches based on C04-1022.3 have been developed to address this problem. These C04-1022.4 provide principled ways of including additional C04-1022.5 other than the C04-1022.6 , such as C04-1022.7 . However, the number of possible choices for C04-1022.8 creates a C04-1022.9 that cannot be searched exhaustively. This paper presents an C04-1022.10 based on C04-1022.11 , which is shown to outperform both C04-1022.12 on two different C04-1022.13 ( C04-1022.14 and C04-1022.15 ).
This paper reports a completed stage of ongoing research at the University of York. Landsbergen's advocacy of E85-1004.1 for E85-1004.2 encourages the application of E85-1004.3 to the construction of a E85-1004.4 returning E85-1004.5 . A E85-1004.6 is presented which implements an E85-1004.7 permitting E85-1004.8 * and interfaces with a language of E85-1004.9 so as to display the E85-1004.10 of corresponding E85-1004.11 . Some familiarity with E85-1004.12 and the E85-1004.13 is assumed.
Theoretical research in the area of E89-1040.1 usually involves the search for and creation of an appropriate E89-1040.2 . An important issue in this respect is the way in which the E89-1040.3 of E89-1040.4 is to be defined. In this paper, we will introduce the E89-1040.5 of the E89-1040.6 . It makes the definition and E89-1040.7 of E89-1040.8 possible, E89-1040.9 which are usually problematic for systems that adhere to E89-1040.10 . In E89-1040.11 , the E89-1040.12 of E89-1040.13 is compositional. The E89-1040.14 is used to define E89-1040.15 such as E89-1040.16 , the E89-1040.17 and the E89-1040.18 mono-lingually. The actual working of the component will be shown in this paper by means of a detailed discussion of E89-1040.19 .
A C96-1062.1 is proposed for the C96-1062.2 of C96-1062.3 in C96-1062.4 . This C96-1062.5 is meant to account for C96-1062.6 which are inferred from the C96-1062.7 of the C96-1062.8 . In particular, we make extensive use of Pustejovsky's principles concerning the C96-1062.9 associated with C96-1062.10 . We argue that it is necessary to draw a line between C96-1062.11 and C96-1062.12 . We explain this distinction and we show how this model may be applied to the C96-1062.13 of C96-1062.14 in C96-1062.15 , provided that complementary C96-1062.16 are retrieved.
This paper considers the problem of automatic assessment of P05-1018.1 . We present a novel P05-1018.2 of P05-1018.3 which is inspired by P05-1018.4 and can be computed automatically from P05-1018.5 . We view P05-1018.6 as a P05-1018.7 and show that the proposed P05-1018.8 supports the effective learning of a P05-1018.9 . Our experiments demonstrate that the P05-1018.10 achieves significantly higher P05-1018.11 than a P05-1018.12 .
P05-1056.1 in P05-1056.2 is important for enriching P05-1056.3 output, making it easier for humans to read and downstream modules to process. In previous work, we have developed P05-1056.4 that integrate textual and prosodic P05-1056.5 for detecting P05-1056.6 . In this paper, we evaluate the use of a P05-1056.7 for this task and relate results with this model to our prior work. We evaluate across two corpora (conversational P05-1056.8 and P05-1056.9 ) on both P05-1056.10 and P05-1056.11 output. In general, our P05-1056.12 model yields a lower error rate than the P05-1056.13 on the P05-1056.14 in P05-1056.15 , although it is interesting to note that the best results are achieved by P05-1056.16 among the P05-1056.17 . This probably occurs because each P05-1056.18 has different strengths and weaknesses for modeling the P05-1056.19 .
P05-2008.1 seeks to identify a piece of P05-2008.2 according to its author's general feeling toward their P05-2008.3 , be it positive or negative. Traditional P05-2008.4 have been applied to this problem with reasonable success, but they have been shown to work well only when there is a good match between the P05-2008.5 with respect to P05-2008.6 . This paper demonstrates that match with respect to domain and time is also important, and presents preliminary experiments with P05-2008.7 labeled with P05-2008.8 , which has the potential of being independent of P05-2008.9 , P05-2008.10 and time.
Using I05-2043.2 , we carried out a trend survey on I05-2043.3 that have been done over the last ten years. We determined the changes in the number of papers published for each research organization and on each research area as well as the relationship between research organizations and research areas. This paper is useful for both recognizing trends in I05-2043.4 and constructing a method of supporting trend surveys using I05-2043.5 .
This paper explores the issue of using different E99-1034.1 between E99-1034.2 for separating E99-1034.3 that are useful for E99-1034.4 from those that are harmful. The hypothesis under examination is that E99-1034.5 tend to be more similar to each other than to other E99-1034.6 . Preliminary experiments with similarities computed using E99-1034.7 seem to confirm the hypothesis. E99-1034.8 could then be used for determining which E99-1034.9 are useful and best reflect the user's information need. A possible application would be to use this source of evidence for tuning the E99-1034.10 of the E99-1034.11 .
We propose a draft scheme of the E85-1041.1 formalizing the E85-1041.2 in E85-1041.3 . The relationships between the interacting partners are considered as system of three automata representing the partners of the E85-1041.4 and environment.
A purely functional implementation of E91-1012.1 is given, together with a simple E91-1012.2 . It is presented as a generalization of the E91-1012.3 . For E91-1012.4 the time-complexity of our E91-1012.5 is cubic if the functions that constitute the E91-1012.6 are implemented as E91-1012.7 , i.e. functions that memorize the results of previous invocations. E91-1012.8 also facilitate a simple way to construct a very compact representation of the E91-1012.9 . For E91-1012.10 , our algorithm is closely related to the E91-1012.11 recently discovered by Kruse-man Aretz [1] and Roberts [2]. E91-1012.12 ( E91-1012.13 with E91-1012.14 at the right hand side) can be parsed with a simple modification of the E91-1012.15 for normal E91-1012.16 .
This paper defines a P05-1010.1 of P05-1010.2 , which we call P05-1010.3 . This P05-1010.4 is an extension of P05-1010.5 in which P05-1010.6 are augmented with P05-1010.7 . Finegrained P05-1010.8 are automatically induced from a P05-1010.9 by P05-1010.10 a P05-1010.11 using an P05-1010.12 . Because exact P05-1010.13 with a P05-1010.14 is P05-1010.15 , several P05-1010.16 are described and empirically compared. In experiments using the P05-1010.17 , our automatically trained P05-1010.18 gave a P05-1010.19 of 86.6% (F1, P05-1010.20 &lt; 40 P05-1010.21 ), which is comparable to that of an P05-1010.22 created using extensive P05-1010.23 .
P05-1053.1 is challenging. This paper investigates the incorporation of diverse P05-1053.2 in P05-1053.3 using P05-1053.4 . Our study illustrates that the base P05-1053.5 information is very effective for P05-1053.6 and contributes to most of the P05-1053.7 from P05-1053.8 aspect while additional information from P05-1053.9 gives limited further enhancement. This suggests that most of useful information in P05-1053.10 for P05-1053.11 is shallow and can be captured by P05-1053.12 . We also demonstrate how P05-1053.13 such as P05-1053.14 and P05-1053.15 , can be used in P05-1053.16 to further improve the P05-1053.17 . P05-1053.18 on the P05-1053.19 shows that effective incorporation of diverse P05-1053.20 enables our P05-1053.21 outperform previously best-reported P05-1053.22 on the P05-1053.23 and significantly outperforms P05-1053.24 by over 20 in P05-1053.25 on the P05-1053.26 .
This paper describes a novel P05-1076.1 for P05-1076.2 ( P05-1076.3 ) and associated frequency information from P05-1076.4  P05-1076.5 . The P05-1076.6 incorporates a P05-1076.7 for 30 P05-1076.8 which tests for the presence of P05-1076.9 ( P05-1076.10 ) in the P05-1076.11 of a robust P05-1076.12 . It uses a powerful P05-1076.13 to classify P05-1076.14 into P05-1076.15 hierarchically in a way that mirrors P05-1076.16 . The P05-1076.17 show that the P05-1076.18 is able to detect P05-1076.19 with P05-1076.20 and P05-1076.21 . A new P05-1076.22 for P05-1076.23 of P05-1076.24 in P05-1076.25 is also introduced which can considerably alleviate the process of obtaining P05-1076.26 for P05-1076.27 .
We present a I05-2013.1 , called I05-2013.2 , which takes as input a I05-2013.3 in I05-2013.4 and produces as output the same I05-2013.5 in which every occurrence of the I05-2013.6 is tagged either with tag I05-2013.7 for I05-2013.8 or I05-2013.9 for I05-2013.10 or I05-2013.11 . This I05-2013.12 is therefore designed to distinguish between the I05-2013.13 , for which an I05-2013.14 has to look for an antecedent, and the I05-2013.15 of this I05-2013.16 , for which it does not make sense to look for an antecedent. The I05-2013.17 for I05-2013.18 is 97,5%. The few I05-2013.19 are analyzed in detail. Other I05-2013.20 using the I05-2013.21 developed for I05-2013.22 are described briefly, as well as the use of I05-2013.23 in a modular I05-2013.24 .
E85-1037.1 has been used for E85-1037.2 work in the past, but the E85-1037.3 have tended be ad hoc or inefficient. This paper presents an approach to systemic E85-1037.4 where E85-1037.5 are applied directly to an unadulterated E85-1037.6 . This E85-1037.7 is made possible by a special relationship between E85-1037.8 and E85-1037.9 : both are organized primarily as choosing from alternatives. The result is simple, efficient E85-1037.10 firmly based in a E85-1037.11 .
This paper presents a E89-1016.1 of the various E89-1016.2 that have been used in the E89-1016.3 . We conclude that previous E89-1016.4 have neglected to evaluate E89-1016.5 in the context of their use, e.g. solving a E89-1016.6 requiring E89-1016.7 . This raises questions about the validity of such E89-1016.8 . In the second half of the paper, we report a E89-1016.9 using the E89-1016.10 to identify E89-1016.11 for carrying out this E89-1016.12 . We evaluate the demands that E89-1016.13 collected using this E89-1016.14 , place upon a E89-1016.15 . We identify three important requirements which arose from the E89-1016.16 that we gave our subjects: operators specific to the task of E89-1016.17 , complex E89-1016.18 and reference to the E89-1016.19 of the E89-1016.20 . We discuss how these might be satisfied by future E89-1016.21 .
E93-1013.1 of E93-1013.2 associate E93-1013.3 with E93-1013.4 by providing E93-1013.5 for E93-1013.6 and E93-1013.7 for determining the E93-1013.8 of larger E93-1013.9 given the E93-1013.10 of their parts. Traditionally, E93-1013.11 are combined via E93-1013.12 , which works well when E93-1013.13 are used to guide E93-1013.14 . More recently, the E93-1013.15 of E93-1013.16 has been used to provide the E93-1013.17 necessary for constraining E93-1013.18 of E93-1013.19 in a E93-1013.20 . It has been difficult, however, to reconcile this E93-1013.21 with the combination of E93-1013.22 by E93-1013.23 . In contrast to E93-1013.24 , we present a E93-1013.25 to assembling E93-1013.26 , based on E93-1013.27 , which meshes well with the unordered nature of E93-1013.28 in the E93-1013.29 . Our use of E93-1013.30 as a 'glue' for assembling E93-1013.31 also allows for a coherent treatment of E93-1013.32 as well as of the E93-1013.33 requirements of E93-1013.34 and E93-1013.35 .
This paper presents an analysis of E95-1036.1 in E95-1036.2 which contain E95-1036.3 , within the framework of E95-1036.4 . The analysis in (Partee, 1984) of E95-1036.5 , introduced by a E95-1036.6 , gives the wrong E95-1036.7 when the E95-1036.8 in the E95-1036.9 is before or after. This E95-1036.10 has been previously analyzed in (de Swart, 1991) as an instance of the E95-1036.11 and given a solution from a E95-1036.12 . By using a careful distinction between the different notions of E95-1036.13 based on (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), we propose a solution to this E95-1036.14 , within the framework of E95-1036.15 . We show some applications of this E95-1036.16 to additional E95-1036.17 in E95-1036.18 .
This paper proposes an automatic, essentially H89-2019.1 which combines H89-2019.2 we have developed for that purpose (the " H89-2019.3 ") and a set of H89-2019.4 for H89-2019.5 (the " H89-2019.6 ", or H89-2019.7 ). The H89-2019.8 checks whether the answer provided by a H89-2019.9 accords with a H89-2019.10 , returning either true or false. The H89-2019.11 determines the H89-2019.12 of H89-2019.13 , the minimal H89-2019.14 that must be included in them, the H89-2019.15 to be included in and excluded from H89-2019.16 , and the H89-2019.17 used by the H89-2019.18 . Though some details of the H89-2019.19 are particular to individual H89-2019.20 , the H89-2019.21 is H89-2019.22 , as is the H89-2019.23 .
Two themes have evolved in H93-1076.3 work at H93-1076.4 that expand and redefine the role of H93-1076.5 in H93-1076.6 . One is the development of systems that provide functionality similar to that of H93-1076.7 but operate directly on H93-1076.8 . A second, related theme is the use of H93-1076.9 to retrieve arbitrary, user-specified information from H93-1076.10 . This paper discusses three research initiatives at H93-1076.11 that exemplify these themes: a H93-1076.12 [1], a H93-1076.13 for H93-1076.14 [12], and a H93-1076.15 for H93-1076.16 [4]. The discussion focuses on key concepts embodied in the research that enable novel H93-1076.17 .
In this paper we present a A97-1028.1 of the A97-1028.2 , a specific A97-1028.3 for which A97-1028.4 in several A97-1028.5 are available. Using the A97-1028.6 of the A97-1028.7 , we propose an A97-1028.8 for A97-1028.9 for A97-1028.10 and discuss the significance of the A97-1028.11 provided by the A97-1028.12 .
We consider the problem of H05-1115.1 from complex H05-1115.2 describing H05-1115.3 . H05-1115.4 generated a list of H05-1115.5 central to understanding each H05-1115.6 in our H05-1115.7 . Because of the dynamic nature of the H05-1115.8 , many H05-1115.9 are time-sensitive (e.g. "How many victims have been found?"). H05-1115.10 found H05-1115.11 providing an H05-1115.12 to each H05-1115.13 . To address the H05-1115.14 , we apply a H05-1115.15 for comparing the relative importance of the H05-1115.16 , which was previously used successfully for H05-1115.17 . Currently, we present a topic-sensitive version of our H05-1115.18 and hypothesize that it can outperform a competitive H05-1115.19 , which compares the H05-1115.20 of each H05-1115.21 to the input H05-1115.22 via H05-1115.23 . In our experiments, the H05-1115.24 achieves a H05-1115.25 that is significantly higher than that of the H05-1115.26 .
A J89-4003.1 is presented to characterize the J89-4003.2 obtained by adding J89-4003.3 to J89-4003.4 . The J89-4003.5 is a J89-4003.6 augmented with the ability to check J89-4003.7 by using the J89-4003.8 in a new way. The J89-4003.9 generated is shown to lie strictly between the J89-4003.10 and the J89-4003.11 . The J89-4003.12 appears capable of accommodating the sort of J89-4003.13 that have been observed to occur in J89-4003.14 , but it excludes many of the unnatural J89-4003.15 that other J89-4003.16 have permitted.
This article is devoted to the problem of I05-6010.1 in I05-6010.2 . After a thorough description of the phenomena, the results of I05-6010.3 are described. Moreover, some examples are given that underline the necessity of integrating some kind of information other than I05-6010.4 into the I05-6010.5 . We argue that a more sophisticated and fine-grained I05-6010.6 in the I05-6010.7 would have very positve effects on I05-6010.8 trained on the I05-6010.9 and on I05-6010.10 induced from the I05-6010.11 , and it would make the I05-6010.12 more valuable as a I05-6010.13 for I05-6010.14 . The information gained from I05-6010.15 and the analyses that are proposed are realized in the framework of I05-6010.16 , a I05-6010.17 and I05-6010.18 for I05-6010.19 .
P83-1004.1 that combine P83-1004.2 and P83-1004.3 allow concise statement of generalizations about the P83-1004.4 of P83-1004.5 . P83-1004.6 , unfortunately, are not computationally safe. We evaluate several proposals for constraining them, basing our assessment on P83-1004.7 . We show that none of them satisfies both criteria, and suggest new directions for research on alternative P83-1004.8 .
In this paper we present a P87-1022.1 of the P87-1022.2 to modeling P87-1022.3 and use it as the basis for an P87-1022.4 to track P87-1022.5 and bind P87-1022.6 . As described in [GJW86], the process of P87-1022.7 gives rise to the P87-1022.8 . We propose an extension to these P87-1022.9 which handles some additional cases of multiple P87-1022.10 . The P87-1022.11 has been implemented in an P87-1022.12 which serves as the interface to a P87-1022.13 .
We present an implemented P95-1013.1 that translates P95-1013.2 into P95-1013.3 , relating concepts of the two P95-1013.4 . While P95-1013.5 has a more elaborated P95-1013.6 of possible P95-1013.7 , P95-1013.8 provides the means to represent P95-1013.9 more explicitly. Our objectives are met by giving clear definitions that determine the P95-1013.10 from the P95-1013.11 , and identify P95-1013.12 , P95-1013.13 and P95-1013.14 .
Valiant showed that P97-1002.1 can be used for P97-1002.2 . We prove a dual result: P97-1002.3 running in P97-1002.4 on a P97-1002.5 and a P97-1002.6 can be used to multiply P97-1002.7 in P97-1002.8 . In the process we also provide a P97-1002.9 of P97-1002.10 motivated by an informal notion due to Lang. Our result establishes one of the first limitations on general P97-1002.11 : a fast, practical P97-1002.12 would yield a fast, practical P97-1002.13 , which is not believed to exist.
This paper introduces P97-1040.1 , a linguistically motivated formalization of P97-1040.2 . P97-1040.3 specifies the P97-1040.4 , the P97-1040.5 , and the two simple families of P97-1040.6 . In contrast to less restricted P97-1040.7 using P97-1040.8 , P97-1040.9 's optimal P97-1040.10 can be generated with P97-1040.11 adapted from (Ellison, 1994). Unfortunately these P97-1040.12 take P97-1040.13 . Indeed the P97-1040.14 is shown P97-1040.15 in this sense. However, techniques are discussed for making P97-1040.16 fast in the typical case, including a simple trick that alone provides a 100-fold speedup on a P97-1040.17 fragment of moderate size. One avenue for future improvements is a new P97-1040.18 , P97-1040.19 , where P97-1040.20 are represented compactly via P97-1040.21 .
We present preliminary results concerning robust techniques for P97-1072.1 . We report our analysis of a collection of 20 P97-1072.2 from the P97-1072.3 and our experiments with P97-1072.4 to identify relations between P97-1072.5 and their P97-1072.6 .
To verify P99-1058.1 by P99-1058.2 , P99-1058.3 are commonly expressed in the P99-1058.4 . P99-1058.5 requires the definition of an appropriately P99-1058.6 of P99-1058.7 . We show how the limited P99-1058.8 of P99-1058.9 can be exploited to derive a hierarchy of P99-1058.10 . Our strategy avoids potential difficulties with approaches that take existing P99-1058.11 of P99-1058.12 as their starting point--such as the need to ensure that all P99-1058.13 in the P99-1058.14 possess a P99-1058.15 .
In this paper, we present an P05-1039.1 for P05-1039.2 which employs P05-1039.3 and P05-1039.4 to achieve a P05-1039.5 of 76.2, higher than previously reported results on the P05-1039.6 . In addition to the high P05-1039.7 of the model, the use of P05-1039.8 in an P05-1039.9 allows us to better examine the interplay between P05-1039.10 and P05-1039.11 results.
This paper proposes an P05-1058.1 to improve P05-1058.2 . The basic idea of P05-1058.3 is to use P05-1058.4 to improve P05-1058.5 results. In this paper, we first train two P05-1058.6 with the large-scale P05-1058.7 and the small-scale P05-1058.8 respectively, and then interpolate these two models to improve the P05-1058.9 . Experimental results show that our approach improves P05-1058.10 in terms of both P05-1058.11 and P05-1058.12 , achieving a P05-1058.13 of 6.56% as compared with the state-of-the-art technologies.
We describe a P05-3001.1 that works with its interlocutor to identify objects. Our contributions include a concise, P05-3001.2 with reversible processes of P05-3001.3 and P05-3001.4 , an P05-3001.5 , and flexible links between P05-3001.6 and P05-3001.7 .
This article deals with the E83-1021.1 of E83-1021.2 underlying the communicative use of E83-1021.3 within the E83-1021.4 . The operations are reduced to E83-1021.5 of a E83-1021.6 , thus changing the level of abstraction of the operations to be performed on E83-1021.7 . In this sense, operations on E83-1021.8 are not merely isomorphic to single epistemological objects, but can be viewed as a simulation of processes on a different level, that pertaining to the E83-1021.9 of E83-1021.10 . For this purpose, we have designed a version of E83-1021.11 which represents the E83-1021.12 , while the new experimental language, E83-1021.13 , represents the E83-1021.14 . KL-Conc would seem to be a more natural and intuitive way of interacting with E83-1021.15 .
The E87-1043.1 are often claimed to convey two kinds of E87-1043.2 : 1. whether the E87-1043.3 described in a E87-1043.4 is E87-1043.5 , E87-1043.6 or E87-1043.7 (= E87-1043.8 ) 2. whether the E87-1043.9 described in a E87-1043.10 is presented as completed, going on, just starting or being finished (= E87-1043.11 ). It will be demonstrated in this paper that one has to add a third component to the analysis of E87-1043.12 , namely whether or not they express E87-1043.13 . The framework of the analysis is E87-1043.14 .
E91-1050.1 is often the appropriate method for expressing E91-1050.2 between E91-1050.3 in the form of E91-1050.4 ; however, there are circumstances in which a different approach is desirable. A E91-1050.5 is presented which permits direct E91-1050.6 of one E91-1050.7 into another, and illustrative examples are given of its application to areas of current interest.
We give an analysis of E93-1025.1 in terms of a straightforward E93-1025.2 that correctly predicts a wide range of phenomena. The treatment does not suffer from problems inherent in E93-1025.3 . Furthermore, in contrast to the approach of Dalrymple et al. [1991], the treatment directly encodes the intuitive distinction between E93-1025.4 and the E93-1025.5 that corefer with them through what we term E93-1025.6 . The correct E93-1025.7 for several problematic examples of E93-1025.8 naturally result. Finally, the analysis extends directly to other E93-1025.9 .
Dividing E99-1023.1 in E99-1023.2 is a useful preprocessing step for E99-1023.3 , E99-1023.4 and E99-1023.5 . (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) have introduced a "convenient" E99-1023.6 for E99-1023.7 by converting it to a E99-1023.8 . In this paper we will examine seven different E99-1023.9 for the problem of recognizing E99-1023.10 . We will show that the E99-1023.11 has a minor influence on E99-1023.12 . However, equipped with the most suitable E99-1023.13 , our E99-1023.14 was able to improve the best published E99-1023.15 for a E99-1023.16 .
In this paper we compare two competing approaches to E95-1021.1 , E95-1021.2 , using E95-1021.3 as our E95-1021.4 . We imposed a time limit on our experiment: the amount of time spent on the design of our E95-1021.5 was about the same as the time we used to train and test the easy-to-implement E95-1021.6 . We describe the two systems and compare the results. The E95-1021.7 of the E95-1021.8 is reasonably good, comparable to E95-1021.9 for E95-1021.10 . But the E95-1021.11 seems to be superior even with the limited time we allowed ourselves for E95-1021.12 .
In order to build robust E99-1015.1 , there is a need for better E99-1015.2 than are currently available. In this paper, we introduce an E99-1015.3 for scientific articles which can be used to build such a E99-1015.4 in a consistent way. The seven categories of the E99-1015.5 are based on E99-1015.6 of E99-1015.7 . Our experimental results show that the E99-1015.8 is stable, reproducible and intuitive to use.
This paper describes an implemented program that takes a H91-1067.1 and generates a partial list of the H91-1067.2 in which each H91-1067.3 occurs. The completeness of the output list increases monotonically with the total H91-1067.4 of each H91-1067.5 in the H91-1067.6 . H91-1067.7 are one to three percent. Five H91-1067.8 are currently detected and we foresee no impediment to detecting many more. Ultimately, we expect to provide a large H91-1067.9 to the H91-1067.10 and to train H91-1067.11 for specific H91-1067.12 .
We focus on the problem of building large A97-1021.1 of A97-1021.2 for A97-1021.3 in multiple A97-1021.4 . One of the main results of this work is the definition of a relation between A97-1021.5 and A97-1021.6 . Our A97-1021.7 takes, as input, the result of previous work on A97-1021.8 and A97-1021.9 , and outputs A97-1021.10 for different A97-1021.11 . These A97-1021.12 have been ported into A97-1021.13 , each containing approximately 9000 A97-1021.14 . We are currently using these A97-1021.15 in an A97-1021.16 and A97-1021.17 .
We investigate the utility of an A97-1050.1 , used previously on a very large A97-1050.2 to acquire general A97-1050.3 , when that A97-1050.4 is applied to a much smaller A97-1050.5 to produce candidates for A97-1050.6 .
J87-1003.1 is shown to be trans-context-free on the basis of J87-1003.2 of the respectively type that involve J87-1003.3 . The J87-1003.4 in question involves J87-1003.5 in J87-1003.6 and J87-1003.7 and is syntactic rather than semantic in nature because J87-1003.8 in J87-1003.9 , like J87-1003.10 in J87-1003.11 such as J87-1003.12 , is partly arbitrary. The formal proof, which makes crucial use of the J87-1003.13 of Ogden et al., is so constructed as to be valid even if J87-1003.14 is presumed to contain J87-1003.15 in which respectively operates across a pair of J87-1003.16 one of whose members has fewer J87-1003.17 than the other; it thus goes through whatever the facts may be regarding J87-1003.18 with unequal numbers of J87-1003.19 in the J87-1003.20 of respectively, whereas other J87-1003.21 have foundered on this problem.
Towards deep analysis of I05-5004.1 , we have examined a I05-5004.2 for collecting I05-5004.3 , in which I05-5004.4 are collected for each I05-5004.5 separately by means of I05-5004.6 and I05-5004.7 . Our preliminary experiments on building a I05-5004.8 have so far been producing promising results, which we have evaluated according to I05-5004.9 , I05-5004.10 , and I05-5004.11 .
A P81-1033.1 can deal with input that deviates from its P81-1033.2 , in addition to input that conforms to it. Ideally, such a P81-1033.3 will correct the deviant input: sometimes, it will be unable to correct it at all; at other times, P81-1033.4 will be possible, but only to within a range of ambiguous possibilities. This paper is concerned with such ambiguous situations, and with making it as easy as possible for the P81-1033.5 to be resolved through consultation with the user of the P81-1033.6 - we presume interactive use. We show the importance of asking the user for clarification in as focused a way as possible. P81-1033.7 of this kind is facilitated by a P81-1033.8 to P81-1033.9 , with P81-1033.10 for each type of P81-1033.11 , and specialized P81-1033.12 for each type of P81-1033.13 that a particular P81-1033.14 can give rise to. A P81-1033.15 also aids in P81-1033.16 by allowing a P81-1033.17 that is natural in terms of the P81-1033.18 to be interpreted directly without compilation into a P81-1033.19 , thus greatly speeding the P81-1033.20 of changes to the P81-1033.21 .
We have implemented a P85-1019.1 called P85-1019.2 . Building on previous work at Carnegie-Mellon University e.g. [4, 5, 8], P85-1019.3 is based on P85-1019.4 . This has the advantages of P85-1019.5 on P85-1019.6 , and P85-1019.7 in the face of P85-1019.8 . While P85-1019.9 is well adapted to simple P85-1019.10 , it handles P85-1019.11 , P85-1019.12 and P85-1019.13 in an ad hoc manner leading to patchy P85-1019.14 . This paper outlines P85-1019.15 as it currently exists and describes our detailed design for extending P85-1019.16 to handle P85-1019.17 , P85-1019.18 , and P85-1019.19 in a general manner.
P91-1025.1 differ in the P91-1025.2 and P91-1025.3 for which they have P91-1025.4 and P91-1025.5 . Therefore P91-1025.6 must sometimes be a matter of approximating the P91-1025.7 of a P91-1025.8 rather than finding an exact counterpart in the P91-1025.9 . We propose a P91-1025.10 based on P91-1025.11 . The basic ingredients are an P91-1025.12 , a P91-1025.13 for P91-1025.14 embedded in P91-1025.15 , and a P91-1025.16 defined in terms of P91-1025.17 . We motivate our approach with examples of P91-1025.18 between P91-1025.19 and P91-1025.20 .
P95-1034.1 requires the integration of vast amounts of P95-1034.2 : lexical, grammatical, and conceptual. A P95-1034.3 must be able to operate well even when pieces of P95-1034.4 are missing. It must also be robust against P95-1034.5 . To attack these problems, we have built a P95-1034.6 , in which gaps in P95-1034.7 are filled by P95-1034.8 . We describe algorithms and show experimental results. We also discuss how the P95-1034.9 can be used to simplify current P95-1034.10 and enhance their P95-1034.11 , even when perfect P95-1034.12 is in principle obtainable.
It is challenging to translate P97-1017.1 and P97-1017.2 across P97-1017.3 with different P97-1017.4 and P97-1017.5 . These items are commonly transliterated, i.e., replaced with approximate P97-1017.6 . For example, computer in P97-1017.7 comes out as ~ i/l:::'=--~-- (konpyuutaa) in P97-1017.8 . Translating such items from P97-1017.9 back to P97-1017.10 is even more challenging, and of practical interest, as transliterated items make up the bulk of P97-1017.11 not found in P97-1017.12 . We describe and evaluate a method for performing P97-1017.13 by P97-1017.14 . This method uses a P97-1017.15 , incorporating several distinct stages in the P97-1017.16 .
Although adequate models of P97-1058.1 for P97-1058.2 and P97-1058.3 are of at least P97-1058.4 , for applications such as P97-1058.5 in which speed is important P97-1058.6 are often preferred. These requirements may be reconciled by using the more complex P97-1058.7 to automatically derive a P97-1058.8 which can then be used as a filter to guide P97-1058.9 or to reject many hypotheses at an early stage of processing. A method is presented here for calculating such P97-1058.10 from P97-1058.11 . It is essentially different from the algorithm introduced by Pereira and Wright (1991; 1996), is faster in some cases, and has the advantage of being open-ended and adaptable.
We present a P99-1036.1 of P99-1036.2 consisting of a set of P99-1036.3 classified by the P99-1036.4 that constitute a P99-1036.5 . The point is quite simple: different P99-1036.6 should be treated differently and the changes between P99-1036.7 are very important because P99-1036.8 has both P99-1036.9 like P99-1036.10 ( P99-1036.11 ) and P99-1036.12 like P99-1036.13 ( P99-1036.14 ). Both P99-1036.15 and P99-1036.16 are improved by the proposed model. The model can achieve 96.6% P99-1036.17 if P99-1036.18 are correctly segmented.
This paper discusses a P99-1080.1 to the problem of assigning P99-1080.2 to P99-1080.3 following a given P99-1080.4 . In contrast with previous P99-1080.5 , an algorithm for selecting P99-1080.6 is considered. The model is to be tested on a standard task, P99-1080.7 , allowing a fair comparison with the well-known P99-1080.8 .
This poster paper describes a E93-1066.1 (Karttunen, 1983; Koskenniemi, 1983) of E93-1066.2 . The description has been implemented using the E93-1066.3 (Antworth, 1990) and is based on a E93-1066.4 of about 23,000 E93-1066.5 . Almost all the special cases of and exceptions to E93-1066.6 have been implemented. E93-1066.7 is an E93-1066.8 with E93-1066.9 formed by E93-1066.10 to E93-1066.11 . E93-1066.12 has E93-1066.13 but nevertheless rather complex morphotactics. E93-1066.14 added to a E93-1066.15 or a E93-1066.16 can convert the E93-1066.17 from a E93-1066.18 to a E93-1066.19 or vice-versa, or can create E93-1066.20 . The E93-1066.21 of E93-1066.22 are constrained and modified by a number of E93-1066.23 such as E93-1066.24 .
The X96-1041.1 has been designed to enable a variety of different X96-1041.2 to use a set of X96-1041.3 . Since X96-1041.4 work best when customized for X96-1041.5 , it is appropriator that no particular X96-1041.6 are described in the X96-1041.7 . However, the X96-1041.8 has constructed several X96-1041.9 that use a common set of configurable X96-1041.10 . These X96-1041.11 were constructed using X96-1041.12 . X96-1041.13 is a X96-1041.14 that can be used to construct X96-1041.15 for a set of common user tasks. X96-1041.16 developed X96-1041.17 to support their work to integrate X96-1041.18 for the 6 and 12 month TIPSTER II demonstrations as well as their Oleada and Temple demonstration projects. This paper briefly describes X96-1041.19 and its capabilities.
This paper ties up some loose ends in P02-1008.1 . First, it discusses how to perform P02-1008.2 under P02-1008.3 consisting of P02-1008.4 . P02-1008.5 has not been much studied in P02-1008.6 ; we show that unlike P02-1008.7 , it does not always yield a regular set, making P02-1008.8 inapplicable. However, after giving a suitably flexible presentation of P02-1008.9 , we show carefully how to treat P02-1008.10 under recent P02-1008.11 in which P02-1008.12 can be compiled into P02-1008.13 . We then unify these variants, showing that P02-1008.14 is possible if all components of the P02-1008.15 are P02-1008.16 , including the P02-1008.17 on P02-1008.18 .
This paper presents the results of a study on the P98-2176.1 imposed on P98-2176.2 by certain P98-2176.3 . We show how such P98-2176.4 are computed and how P98-2176.5 between them and the P98-2176.6 of a P98-2176.7 can be automatically established using P98-2176.8 . Based on this P98-2176.9 , we have developed a technique for P98-2176.10 of P98-2176.11 of P98-2176.12 in P98-2176.13 . We discuss the underlying relationship between the P98-2176.14 of choosing an appropriate P98-2176.15 that serves a specific purpose in the P98-2176.16 and the P98-2176.17 of the P98-2176.18 itself. We present our work in the framework of the more general concept of reuse of P98-2176.19 that are automatically extracted from P98-2176.20 . We present a formal evaluation of our approach and we conclude with some thoughts on potential applications of our method.
In the second year of H94-1024.1 of the H94-1024.2 , methodologies developed and tested in 1992 were applied to the H94-1024.3 . The current methodology optimizes the inherently H94-1024.4 on H94-1024.5 by channeling the H94-1024.6 of H94-1024.7 into many H94-1024.8 which reflect both the comparison of the H94-1024.9 of the H94-1024.10 with H94-1024.11 and against the H94-1024.12 of H94-1024.13 . This paper discusses the three H94-1024.14 used in the H94-1024.15 , the results of the evaluations , and preliminary characterizations of the H94-1024.16 , now underway. The efforts under discussion focus on measuring the progress of H94-1024.17 and increasing the sensitivity and H94-1024.18 of H94-1024.19 .
This paper describes to what extent C02-1071.1 may benefit from C02-1071.2 and it presents a C02-1071.3 which integrates a C02-1071.4 as a preprocessing module of a C02-1071.5 . Experiments show that the C02-1071.6 of the overall analysis improves significantly and that our system also provides C02-1071.7 to the C02-1071.8 while maintaining both the C02-1071.9 and the C02-1071.10 of the C02-1071.11 .
In this paper, we compare the performance of a state-of-the-art P06-2067.1 (Bikel, 2004) in parsing P06-2067.2 and in generating P06-2067.3 from P06-2067.4 . Although P06-2067.5 achieves a higher P06-2067.6 for parsing P06-2067.7 , it achieves a higher P06-2067.8 when extracting P06-2067.9 from P06-2067.10 . Our experiments also show that current technology for P06-2067.11 initially designed for P06-2067.12 works equally well for P06-2067.13 . Additionally, we explore the utility of P06-2067.14 in helping P06-2067.15 and P06-2067.16 of P06-2067.17 . Our experiments show that P06-2067.18 is of little help in parsing P06-2067.19 and extracting P06-2067.20 from P06-2067.21 . This indicates that there is no need to add P06-2067.22 in transcribing P06-2067.23 simply in order to help P06-2067.24 .
This paper describes a C94-1088.1 and discusses the advantages of it over a traditional C94-1088.2 . Since C94-1088.3 are not conventionally marked in C94-1088.4 , a C94-1088.5 has the dual advantages of avoiding C94-1088.6 and directly accessing C94-1088.7 . Furthermore, C94-1088.8 can be obtained through an auxiliary module of C94-1088.9 .
An efficient C04-1024.1 for C04-1024.2 is presented. The C04-1024.3 computes a compact C04-1024.4 of the complete set of possible C04-1024.5 and long C04-1024.6 . The C04-1024.7 uses C04-1024.8 to parallelise the C04-1024.9 . The C04-1024.10 is particularly useful when all analyses are needed rather than just the most probable one.
In this paper we describe and evaluate a N04-1008.1 that goes beyond answering factoid questions. We focus on N04-1008.2 , and build our system around a N04-1008.3 which exploits both a N04-1008.4 for N04-1008.5 and a N04-1008.6 for N04-1008.7 , trained on a N04-1008.8 of 1 million N04-1008.9 collected from the Web.
The applicability of many current P05-1046.1 is severely limited by the need for P05-1046.2 . We demonstrate that for certain P05-1046.3 , such as classified advertisements and bibliographic citations, small amounts of P05-1046.4 can be used to learn effective models in a primarily unsupervised fashion. Although P05-1046.5 provide a suitable P05-1046.6 for P05-1046.7 , general P05-1046.8 fails to learn useful structure in either of our domains. However, one can dramatically improve the quality of the learned structure by exploiting simple P05-1046.9 of the desired solutions. In both domains, we found that P05-1046.10 can attain P05-1046.11 with 400 P05-1046.12 comparable to those attained by P05-1046.13 on 50 P05-1046.14 , and that P05-1046.15 can make good use of small amounts of P05-1046.16 .
Despite much recent progress on accurate P05-1073.1 , previous work has largely used P05-1073.2 , possibly combined with separate P05-1073.3 via P05-1073.4 . This stands in stark contrast to the linguistic observation that a P05-1073.5 is a joint structure, with strong P05-1073.6 between P05-1073.7 . We show how to build a P05-1073.8 of P05-1073.9 , incorporating novel P05-1073.10 that model these interactions into P05-1073.11 . This system achieves an P05-1073.12 of 22% on all P05-1073.13 and 32% on P05-1073.14 over a state-of-the art independent P05-1073.15 for P05-1073.16 on P05-1073.17 .
We propose a method of organizing reading materials for P05-3030.1 . It enables us to select a concise set of reading P05-3030.2 (from a P05-3030.3 ) that contains all the P05-3030.4 to be learned. We used a specialized P05-3030.5 for an English certification test as the P05-3030.6 and used P05-3030.7 , a free-content encyclopedia, as the P05-3030.8 . The organized reading materials would enable learners not only to study the P05-3030.9 efficiently but also to gain a variety of knowledge through reading. The reading materials are available on our web site.
In this paper a system which understands and conceptualizes E83-1029.1 is presented. Specifically, the following components of the system are described: the E83-1029.2 , based on a E83-1029.3 , the E83-1029.4 relying on the E83-1029.5 , and the E83-1029.6 .
A proposal to deal with E89-1006.1 in the framework of E89-1006.2 is presented, as it has been implemented for a fragment at the E89-1006.3 . It is based on the E89-1006.4 of H. Kamp and Ch. Rohrer. Instead of using E89-1006.5 to express the E89-1006.6 of the E89-1006.7 the Reichenbachian point of view is adopted and refined such that the impact of the E89-1006.8 with respect to the E89-1006.9 of the E89-1006.10 is understood as contribution to the integration of the E89-1006.11 of a E89-1006.12 in the E89-1006.13 of the preceeding E89-1006.14 . Thereby a E89-1006.15 provided by the preceeding E89-1006.16 and by the E89-1006.17 of the E89-1006.18 being processed is used. This system consists of one or more E89-1006.19 and E89-1006.20 , the E89-1006.21 and the E89-1006.22 . The special interest of our proposal is to establish a plausible choice of anchors for the E89-1006.23 out of the E89-1006.24 and to update this E89-1006.25 correctly. The problem of choice is largely neglected in the literature. In opposition to the approach of Kamp and Rohrer the exact E89-1006.26 of the E89-1006.27 is fixed by the E89-1006.28 and not in the process of E89-1006.29 .
In this paper we introduce a E93-1004.1 for imposing E93-1004.2 on E93-1004.3 , and an extension E93-1004.4 for imposing E93-1004.5 on E93-1004.6 . The motivation for introducing these E93-1004.7 is to provide tools for formalising E93-1004.8 perspicuously, and the paper illustrates this by showing how the leading ideas of E93-1004.9 can be captured in E93-1004.10 . In addition, the role of E93-1004.11 (and in particular, what we have called as E93-1004.12 for linguistic theorising is discussed in some detail.
One of the claimed benefits of E99-1029.1 is that they have an E99-1029.2 . We consider how this can be exploited to limit the need for E99-1029.3 during E99-1029.4 . We compare two wide-coverage E99-1029.5 , E99-1029.6 and E99-1029.7 , finding that the two E99-1029.8 exploit E99-1029.9 in different ways.
We provide a unified account of E95-1033.1 within the framework of a E95-1033.2 . Criteria for E95-1033.3 within E95-1033.4 rephrase major concepts from E95-1033.5 , while those for E95-1033.6 incorporate an adapted version of a E95-1033.7 .
Recently, we initiated a project to develop a H89-1027.1 called H89-1027.2 . In contrast to many of the past efforts that make use of H89-1027.3 whose development requires intense H89-1027.4 , our approach attempts to express the H89-1027.5 within a formal framework using well-defined mathematical tools. In our system, H89-1027.6 and H89-1027.7 are discovered and trained automatically, using a large body of H89-1027.8 . This paper describes the system, and documents its current performance.
A method of H91-1077.1 is proposed that is based on H91-1077.2 , an on-line H91-1077.3 that incorporates H91-1077.4 ( H91-1077.5 , H91-1077.6 , H91-1077.7 , H91-1077.8 , H91-1077.9 ) as H91-1077.10 between H91-1077.11 . With H91-1077.12 , it is easy to retrieve sets of H91-1077.13 , a facility that will be used for H91-1077.14 during H91-1077.15 , as follows. When a H91-1077.16 with multiple H91-1077.17 is encountered, one of two procedures will be followed. Either, (1) H91-1077.18 related in H91-1077.19 to the H91-1077.20 of the H91-1077.21 will be retrieved; new H91-1077.22 will be derived by substituting these related H91-1077.23 into the H91-1077.24 of the H91-1077.25 ; a large H91-1077.26 will then be searched for these H91-1077.27 ; and that H91-1077.28 will be chosen that corresponds to the H91-1077.29 that is found most often in the H91-1077.30 . Or, (2) the H91-1077.31 of the H91-1077.32 will be used as a key to search a large H91-1077.33 ; all H91-1077.34 found to occur in that H91-1077.35 will be noted; H91-1077.36 will then be used to estimate the H91-1077.37 from those H91-1077.38 to the H91-1077.39 of the H91-1077.40 ; and that H91-1077.41 will be chosen that is closest in H91-1077.42 to other H91-1077.43 occurring in the same H91-1077.44 If successful, this procedure could have practical applications to problems of H91-1077.45 , H91-1077.46 , H91-1077.47 , and elsewhere.
In this paper, we want to show how the A97-1027.1 of an existing A97-1027.2 has been extended in order to produce output that is compatible with the A97-1027.3 of the A97-1027.4 of the New York University. The former can take advantage of the A97-1027.5 of the latter, while focusing on A97-1027.6 for A97-1027.7 . This general strategy will be illustrated by a practical application, namely the highlighting of relevant information in a A97-1027.8 by means of modern A97-1027.9 . Such an application can be of use for medical administrative purposes in a hospital environment.
We describe a novel technique and implemented system for constructing a A97-1052.1 from A97-1052.2 . Each A97-1052.3 encodes the A97-1052.4 of a comprehensive set of A97-1052.5 for A97-1052.6 . An initial experiment, on a sample of 14 A97-1052.7 which exhibit A97-1052.8 , demonstrates that the technique achieves A97-1052.9 comparable to previous approaches, which are all limited to a highly restricted set of A97-1052.10 . We also demonstrate that a A97-1052.11 built with the system improves the A97-1052.12 of a A97-1052.13 by an appreciable amount
This paper shows how J87-3001.1 can be analysed by applying a hierarchy of J87-3001.2 . An experimental system embodying this mechanism has been implemented for processing J87-3001.3 from the J87-3001.4 . A property of this J87-3001.5 , exploited by the system, is that it uses a J87-3001.6 in its J87-3001.7 . The structures generated by the experimental system are intended to be used for the J87-3001.8 of new J87-3001.9 in terms of the J87-3001.10 of J87-3001.11 in the J87-3001.12 . Examples illustrating the output generated are presented, and some qualitative performance results and problems that were encountered are discussed. The analysis process applies successively more specific J87-3001.13 as determined by a hierarchy of J87-3001.14 in which less specific J87-3001.15 dominate more specific ones. This ensures that reasonable incomplete analyses of the J87-3001.16 are produced when more complete analyses are not possible, resulting in a relatively robust J87-3001.17 . Thus the work reported addresses two J87-3001.18 faced by current experimental J87-3001.19 : coping with an incomplete J87-3001.20 and with incomplete J87-3001.21 of J87-3001.22 .
This paper presents an I05-5009.1 employing a I05-5009.2 for I05-5009.3 with their I05-5009.4 . We assume that the I05-5009.5 of a I05-5009.6 is indicated by a I05-5009.7 of the I05-5009.8 as a I05-5009.9 and that the I05-5009.10 of each I05-5009.11 can be inferred. A I05-5009.12 is evaluated for whether its I05-5009.13 are used in the same I05-5009.14 . Experimental results showed that the proposed method achieves almost 60% I05-5009.15 and that there is not a large performance difference between the two I05-5009.16 . The results also revealed an upper bound of I05-5009.17 of 77% with the I05-5009.18 when using only I05-5009.19 .
An extension to the P83-1003.1 is proposed, allowing P83-1003.2 to consist of finite sequences of P83-1003.3 , and allowing P83-1003.4 to range over such sequences. The extension is shown to be sufficient to provide a strongly adequate P83-1003.5 for P83-1003.6 , as found in e.g. P83-1003.7 . The structures induced for such P83-1003.8 are argued to be more appropriate to data involving P83-1003.9 than some previous proposals have been. The extension is shown to be parseable by a simple extension to an existing P83-1003.10 for P83-1003.11 .
